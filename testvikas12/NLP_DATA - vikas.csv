Dear compatriots,
On the occasion of October 18th, the “Day of Peruvians residing abroad,” it gives me great pleasure to convey, on behalf of President of the Republic and the Ministry of External Relations, our cordial and affectionate greetings and gratitude for the valuable every day support, you bring to our country and societies that you host, in addition to the important work of spreading cultural values and promote the image of Peru.
Rest assured that your great effort ambitions us as a Government, to deepen those activities oriented towards the continuous development of policies to promote, support and protect, and to the continuous improvement of consular services in order to safeguard your rights and to contribute to their proper insertion in the countries where you live.
In this context, allow me to point out that through institutional mechanisms such as the IntersectorialWorking Table for Migration Management, are coordinated the activities aimed at promoting the signing of bilateral and multilateral agreements on migration, social security, fight against trafficking, seeking to strengthen their effective implementation for the benefit of each of you.
Also, I am pleased to let you know that recently was published the Supreme Decree 050-2012-RE initiating theModernization Process of the Administration of the Ministry of Foreign Relations, the same that includes strengthening our consular network infrastructure and the best systematization of its processes in order to offer quality services, protection and assistance to those compatriots who need them.
On the other hand, due to the merit of thesolidary support of our nationals, resident abroad, the Chancellery established a few years ago a mechanism for the recognition of Peruvians who have shown support through social activities in the benefit of compatriots or of those directed towards strengthening and union of Peruvian community abroad. In this regard, this year were selected ten (10) fellow residents in the cities Amsterdam, Asunción, Quito, Bern, Rome, Santiago, Los Ángeles and Dallaspara, who reflects the gratitude of the State of Peru to the whole Peruvian community living outside the country.
Gratitude to those remarkable Peruvians is the mirroring of the important respect that these people have earned from their community while maintaining the essence of mutual and collective support that characterizes us. In this regard, I must say that the very associations and advisory councils were those who, rightly, have proposed them.
There is renewed the promise of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to continue to deepen the activities aimed at providing the best services to reinforcing ties with Peru and to promote social integration of our compatriots in host countries.
Best wishes of prosperity for you and your families on this day of great significance for all Peruvians.

Sir James Paice: 'Treasury doesn't understand farming',www.bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-22767470,04-06-13 12:02,"Image caption Pressures facing farmers are not understood in parliament, says Sir James Paice
There can be few politicians who understand the world of farming better than Conservative Cambridgeshire MP and farmer Sir James Paice.
That's why he's played a key role in overseeing agriculture at Westminster for the best part of 24 years.
First he was a member of a backbench horticulture committee, then a Parliamentary private secretary, a shadow minister and finally Minister for Agriculture; a post he held for for two-and-a-half years before being moved in last year's reshuffle.
I have little doubt that there's a huge section of government that does not understand farming and has certainly not kept up to speed with the changes Sir James Paice MP, (Con) South East Cambridgeshire
After all that time he makes a rather damning observation: a large number of people in government do not understand farming.
It's a comment which many in the industry have made on numerous occasions but this is from someone who has been at the heart of it all.
Main culprit
""I think it's true - I have little doubt that there's a huge section of government that does not understand farming and has certainly not kept up to speed with the changes.""
He says the main culprit is the Treasury.
""Some of the rhetoric is still about surpluses, wanting to cut production and farmers being subsidised.
""They haven't caught up with the fact that the last CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) round actually stopped subsidising production altogether.
""Farmers get nothing now that's linked to how much they produce. They get a flat rate payment - it's not subsidised production but the rhetoric hasn't caught up with reality.""
His worry is that British farmers will lose out in the latest round of CAP negotiations because those involved in them are not prepared to fight for farming.
'Precious resource'
Already France has gained an extra £1bn for its farmers. The latest figures suggest that already our farmers receive less per hectare than many European colleagues.
""I fear those decisions were taken at the behest of the Treasury rather than driven by what's in the best interest of British farmers and consumers,"" said the MP for South East Cambridgeshire.
The negotiations are continuing and Sir James still hopes for a decent deal - but he's worried that once again we'll lose out.
It begs the question - if he's failed to get farming taken more seriously at Westminster, what more can anyone else do?
""I think they'll be forced to change in the coming years. We are seeing this whole change in the world with increasing global population coupled with climate change, which is going to make food a precious resource.
""Every country is going to have to have to do its bit - and I think the government is going to have to realise that this is a pretty critical industry for everybody. We've got to feed our people"".",james paice,04-06-13 12:02,e7fd43cf35457fb086b931fb7719332e175b85167cea3716fe79118adad273e0,0.266077055,"[{'score': 0.47348475456237793, 'topic': 'assets'}]","[{'sentiment': 'None', 'score': 0, 'name': 'None', 'topic': 'None'}]","Image caption Pressures facing farmers are not understood in parliament, says Sir James Paice

Amari Saifi,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amari_Saifi,20-01-09 21:26,"Amari Saifi (born c. 1956),[1] also known under his aliases Abou Haidara or Abderrazak le Para, is one of the leaders of the Islamist militia Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC).
According to Paris Match, Saifi claims to have been the head of the bodyguard of the Algerian defense minister Khaled Nezzar from 1990 to 1993.[2] It is believed that he joined the armed Islamist movement in 1992 and later advanced to become the second-in-command of the GSPC, but his name did not appear on the GSPC website until 2004.[3] His nickname ""El Para"" is derived from ""paratrooper"", as he is believed to have been a trained parachutist in the Algerian armed forces before integrating in the Islamist network.[4]
Saifi became widely known when he was identified as one of the kidnappers who abducted in 2003 a group of 32 tourists, most of them German, in Algeria. It was then that the Algerian government claimed that the former military agent had switched sides and defected.[citation needed]
After the hostages were released in two groups - one liberated by the Algerian army, the other against ransom - Saifi and 50 of his men allegedly left northern Mali and were pursued through Niger by combined Algerian and Malian forces into northern Chad.[4]
In March 2004, Saifi was captured by the Movement for Democracy and Justice in Chad (MDJT), a Chadian rebel group. The MDJT leaders tried to have him sent to Germany to stand trial, but finally handed him over to the Algerian secret services in October 2004.[3] In June 2005, the Algerian government announced that he had been sentenced to life imprisonment.[5]
An investigation by Le Monde diplomatique assured in 2005 that Saifi was not a true Islamist but an agent of the Algerian government who staged a false flag attack by kidnapping the tourists.[3] The British writer Jeremy Keenan elaborated on this theory since 2006, speculating that the supposed presence of (false) Islamist extremist terror elements in southern Algeria would allow the US to broaden their counterterrorist agreements with several Sahel countries.[6]
In March 2011, the Algerian justice minister Tayeb Belaiz stated that Hassan Hattab had been put in a safe place, whereas Amari Saifi or Abderezzak El Para had been imprisoned.[7]",Saifi Ammari,20-01-09 21:26,099afa0438fb781df2c4f23a43551b75b5584b07fa30236cab43e333de6dc431,0.731362748,"[{'score': 0, 'topic': 'None'}]","[{'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.5018701553344727, 'name': 'Amari Saifi', 'topic': 'terrorism'}]","Amari Saifi (born c. 1956),[1] also known under his aliases Abou Haidara or Abderrazak le Para, is one of the leaders of the Islamist militia Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC).","[{'name': 'GSPC'}, {'name': 'Abderezzak El Para'}, {'name': 'Khaled Nezzar'}, {'name': 'Amari Saifi'}, {'name': 'Jeremy Keenan'}, {'name': 'Sahel'}, {'name': 'Hassan Hattab'}, {'name': 'Abou Haidara'}, {'name': 'Tayeb Belaiz'}, {'org_name': 'MDJT'}, {'org_name': 'Niger'}, {'org_name': 'El Para'}, {'org_name': 'the Movement for Democracy and Justice'}, {'org_name': 'Abderrazak le Para'}, {'org_name': 'Paris Match'}, {'org_name': 'Le Monde'}, {'org_name': 'Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat'}]",

After primary and secondary education, he attended Askeri Tibbiye Idadisi (military pre-medical college). Upon graduation, he attended Mekteb-i Tibbiye-i Askeriye (military medical school) for one year and escaped to Geneva where he continued his education. He eventually prepared his doctoral dissertation under Prof. Bard. He visited Pasteur Institute in Paris. The scientific environment in this institute had a big influence on Akil Muhtar. Another major influence on his scientific and research formation was Prof. Mayor, expert in Pharmaco-dynamics which was then a new discipline. Akil Muhtar obtained his ""doçent"" title under Prof. Mayor and discovered ""Muhtar Refleks"" in the same period. He returned to Istanbul upon the invitation of government. A major contribution of Akil Muhtar to Turkish medicine is his initiation and establishing of pharmaco-dynamics as a new discipline. His other major contribution was the founding of a modern internal medicine department. As a scientist, Akil Muhtar never isolated himself from social life and assumed challenging administrative and social responsibilities in very difficult times. He continued in Istanbul the scientific research that he had initiated in Geneva. He proved that digital showed its effect only in a few hours. Not nearly as long as the scientific community had been assuming in his times. He invented the santonin test, used in testing the liver functions in different diseases. This test, was eventually included in medical books as the ""liver function test"". Akil Muhtar retired in 1943 and was elected as a representative of the Parliament in 1946.

“We are getting used to this new normal, which hopefully won’t last forever and Parliament has reopened with the help of technology.
We have seen this in the way households across our local area have taken to following the new rules and restrictions. I would like to thank everyone who is staying at home wherever possible in order to help fight this virus. The greatest gratitude goes to those who are working to save lives, to keep us safe and to produce, deliver and distribute food and essential items. Nurses, doctors, the police, transport workers, shopkeepers, cleaners and many others are the backbone of the country in this crisis.
We have now been in lockdown for more than a month and we are all feeling its impact, including the loss of many loved ones to Covid-19. I pray for them and their families and I invite you to remember them by lighting a candle every night at 9pm.
Every Thursday at 8pm, people across Morley and Outwood have joined with others up and down the country to demonstrate their support for the NHS on the doorstep. This simple gesture, to Clap for Carers, is a powerful display of support for those on the frontline.
Over at Pinderfields Hospital, banners have been placed by well-wishers to show their support to workers as they drive in each day.
A key issue is an upsurge in global demand for personal protective equipment (PPE). Without this gear, those on the frontline would not be able to do their jobs. Having reached out to those with a particular need, I am pleased to say that a number of local businesses have stepped forward to help ease that supply with generous donations. I have personally contacted all the care homes in my constituency to ask about their need and concerns, feeding back to the relevant authorities and delivering PPE with a group of volunteers.
With people isolated in their homes, it was only inevitable that we would have less of an idea about what is going on in their communities. I have been astounded by the great response to my call for Covid-19 volunteers to help to make a difference for those in particular need.
Often, volunteers are helping in the simplest of ways. Many of those at great risk from coronavirus were struggling to get hold of day-to-day essentials. In response, I’ve coordinated a united response with volunteers delivering food and medicine to those unable to leave home.
Volunteers even phone the lonely to ensure they have at least some contact. The large number of volunteers across our, and all, communities, should comfort us in these uncertain times.

Turkey Seeks to Attract English and Spanish Tourists from the Costa del Sol and the Costa Blanca with new four-stage Healthy Tourism Certification,www.euroweeklynews.com,https://www.euroweeklynews.com/2020/05/11/turkey-seeks-to-attract-english-and-spanish-tourists-from-the-costa-del-sol-and-the-costa-blanca-with-new-four-stage-healthy-tourism-certification/,11-05-20 11:03,"A four-stage Healthy Tourism Certification has been initiated by Turkey as the country seeks to attract foreign tourists from the Costa del Sol and the Costa Blanca in Spain this summer once Covid-19 lockdown restrictions are eased.
THE four main pillars in the certification initiative cover the health and safety of passengers and employees, precautions at tourist facilities, and transportation.
Under the proposals, passengers will not be allowed to enter airports without face masks and they will be subject to thermal camera and body temperature measurements at the entrance to terminal buildings.
Processes will need to be implemented by hotels covering food and drink facilities, the implementation and control of measures such as social distancing, contact and isolation “which are required to control the spread of pandemic within the personnel working at such facilities.”
-- Advertisement --
Measures and regulations for air, land and sea travel include “safe distance standards.” Hospitality staff will be trained in procedures such as hygiene and sanitation. The Turkish tourism and culture ministry wants to measure to be applicable “as of the summer season of 2020.”
Culture and tourism minister Mehmet Nuri Ersoy said: “This certificate programme demonstrates that Turkey will take a pioneering role in terms of setting the direction for the normalisation of tourism.
“Global quarantine measures, which have been taken due to Covid-19, causing unique developments all around the world, and today these measures are getting more flexible.
“The tourism sector itself has a vital role in terms of returning to normal processes. The importance of caring for our guests in our culture leads us to be ready for the transition to healthy tourism before everyone.
“Our certification programme shall ensure that our guests in Turkey are going to make their holidays safely and hygienic and feel comfortable during their visit.
“Our programme covers preventive and protective steps including air, marine and land transportation, arrival ports, all facilities providing a holiday experience, health condition of employees in the industry, and tourists themselves. We will encourage all of our transportation and accommodation facilities to take all precautions for a healthy holiday through obtaining the certificate.”

​Action Imposes Sanctions on Six Individuals and Three Entities Tied to the North Korean Government’s Illicit Activities
WASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated a number of individuals and entities with ties to North Korea’s weapons proliferation and illicit finance efforts. OFAC’s action against six individuals and three entities is designed to counter attempts to circumvent U.S. and UN sanctions, prevent the North Korean Government from accessing the U.S. financial system, and maintain U.S. sanctions effectiveness on individuals and entities that are linked to North Korea’s procurement of weapons of mass destruction (WMD)-related materials and proliferation activities. As a result of today’s action, any property or interest in property of the designated persons in the possession of U.S. persons or within U.S. jurisdiction must be frozen. Additionally, transactions by U.S. persons involving the designated persons are generally prohibited.
“North Korea threatens international peace and security by expanding its nuclear program and continuing its proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons,” said Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Adam J. Szubin. “Treasury is committed to exposing North Korea’s global proliferation network and excluding these facilitators from the international financial system.”
Today’s action was taken pursuant to two Executive Orders (E.O.s) related to North Korea: E.O. 13382, which targets proliferators of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their supporters and E.O. 13551, which targets, among others, those involved in North Korea’s weapons trade. These designations also complement today’s listing of the Strategic Rocket Force of the Korean People’s Army by the U.S. Department of State under E.O 13382.
E.O. 13382 Designations
OFAC designated six individuals pursuant to E.O. 13382, which targets proliferators of WMD and their supporters. Kim Kyong Nam was designated for acting, or purporting to act, for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the Foreign Trade Bank (FTB), North Korea’s primary foreign exchange bank. FTB is an entity whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13382 for facilitating transactions on behalf of Specially Designated Nationals linked to North Korea’s proliferation network. Kim Kyong Nam is FTB’s representative in Khabarovsk, Russia.
OFAC also designated the following five Tanchon Commercial Bank (TCB) representatives pursuant to E.O. 13382 for acting for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, TCB, which was previously designated by the U.S. and UN as a financial arm of Korea Mining Development Trading Corporation (KOMID): Jang Bom Su, Jon Myong Guk, Ko Tae Hun, Choe Song Il, and Kim Jung Jong. Jang Bom Su and Jon Myong Guk are TCB representatives in Syria. Ko Tae Hun and Jon Myong Guk facilitate the cross-border movement of KOMID funds. Choe Song Il and Kim Jung Jong are TCB representatives in Vietnam.
In addition to OFAC’s designations, the U.S. Department of State designated the Strategic Rocket Force of the Korean People’s Army pursuant to E.O. 13382 for engaging in activities that have materially contributed to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or their means of delivery. The Strategic Force conducted multiple ballistic missile launches during 2014. Specifically, it conducted the launches of two short-range Scud-class ballistic missiles on March 3, test-fired two medium-range No Dong-class ballistic missiles on March 26, and conducted the launch of a short-range ballistic missile on July 26. All missiles had a range of 500km or greater. The launches of these missiles materially contributed to North Korea’s ballistic missile program.
E.O. 13551 Designations
OFAC designated the following three shipping companies pursuant to E.O. 13551 for being owned or controlled by or acting for or on behalf of U.S.- and UN-designated Ocean Maritime Management Company (OMM): Haejin Ship Management Company Limited, Pyongjin Ship Management Company Limited, and Yongjin Ship Management Company Limited. OMM is a North Korean shipping company that uses a variety of aliases and front companies to operate internationally. OMM attempted to import a concealed shipment of arms and related materiel to North Korea aboard the DPRK-flagged cargo vessel Chong Chon Gang in July 2013. It used deliberate and evasive methods to conceal the illicit cargo of arms and related materiel.

""The apprenticeship I did opened many doors for me, but that opportunity isn’t as available today as it should be to working-class people. I want to help change that.""
Gillian Keegan was steadily building a political career when she happened to meet fellow London Business School (LBS) alumna Justine Greening at Reunion in 2015.
The pair chatted for two hours, with Justine – now Secretary of State for Education and Minister for Women and Equalities – happy to give her tips for getting ahead in UK politics. “I asked if she minded giving me some guidance on becoming an MP,” Gillian says. “She explained how she got into parliament and what I needed to know to take the same journey.”
For Gillian, getting advice from an LBS alumna shows how powerful the School’s network is. Since then, she has achieved her ambition of becoming a British MP by winning the Chichester seat in the 2017 general election.
Coming from a working-class background, Gillian’s motivation is to give others the same opportunities she had. She counts herself lucky to have had a successful business career that started when she joined a car factory as an apprentice, aged 16. But others from the same background aren’t so fortunate.
“There’s a contrast between where I started in Huyton (Merseyside) and where I ended up. Not many people have the chance to become a senior executive in business [Gillian worked for manufacturing, banking and IT companies in the UK and Spain) and then a politician. The apprenticeship I did opened many doors for me, but that opportunity isn’t as available today as it should be to working-class people. I want to help change that.”
From LBS to a life in politics
Gillian’s decision to become a politician can be traced back to an LBS lecture by Lynda Gratton, Professor of Management Practice, in 2010. At the time, Gillian was taking the Sloan Masters in Leadership and Strategy. “I was inspired when listening to Lynda talk about how people were more likely to live longer, giving them time for two or three careers,” Gillian says.
“I had been in international business for 27 years and didn’t want to do the same thing for the next 27 years. So while working out what I wanted to do next, I decided to take the Sloan.”
The programme taught Gillian how leaders need to adapt to an ever-changing world. “What got you into the role of leader is no longer enough,” she says. “You have to change from being the smartest person in the room to coaching the smartest people in the room.”
Taking the Sloan was an opportunity to think about her own leadership style and the challenges facing today’s executives. “The 21st century leadership model is one where you’re constantly on show and connected through social media. There’s an expectation that you’ll be accessible, which is one of the things that puts people off going into politics.”
Despite the drawbacks, Gillian decided to pursue a career in politics after completing the Sloan. She says LBS prepared her for life as a politician and provided friends who offer alternative political views.
“For anyone studying at LBS, having a strong group within your stream is really important. They’re not only friends for life, but also people who you can discuss things with in confidence. I have a group of LBS friends I talk to about politics. They all have varying jobs, experiences, backgrounds and political views, which is ideal as they bring different perspectives.”",gillian keegan,26-07-20 0:00,68b6a4c2b4f75c0b4f917e18c7990760b31b199832cf74462405b12d1dc2744e,0.262947854,"[{'score': 0.41543132066726685, 'topic': 'assets'}]","[{'sentiment': 'None', 'score': 0, 'name': 'None', 'topic': 'None'}]","Degree Programme: LBS Sloan Masters

PM dismisses news of Ankara mayor resignation as ‘rumors’,www.hurriyetdailynews.com,https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/president-erdogan-meets-ankara-mayor-after-calls-for-resignation-120446,26-07-20 0:00,"PM dismisses news of Ankara mayor resignation as ‘rumors’
ANKARA
Recent reports about the potential resignation of Ankara Mayor Melih Gökçek are just “rumors,” Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım has claimed, despite growing speculation that the capital’s long-time mayor is on the list of officials whose resignation has been sought by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
“One should not act on a mere rumor. Who told you [about Gökçek’s resignation]?” Yıldırım told reporters on Oct. 6, responding to questions on reports of Gökçek’s resignation.
His comments came after President Erdoğan, the head of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), held a nearly three-hour meeting with Gökçek late on Oct. 5, widely interpreted as his call for the Ankara mayor to step aside.
Presidential sources said the meeting took place upon Gökçek’s demand, while after the meeting the Ankara mayor claimed on his Twitter account that the meeting was about “plans for a museum to be built across from Erdoğan’s presidential complex” in the capital.
Erdoğan also had a one-hour meeting with Erol Kaya, the AKP’s deputy leader responsible for local administrations, at the presidency on Oct. 6. No official statement was made after the meeting.
The president’s office, however, denied media reports saying Erdoğan met with Balıkesir Mayor Edip Uğur, who is also thought to be on a list of mayors who have been asked to resign.
Questions linger over the fate of mayors of key cities in Turkey amid recent resignations from Istanbul Mayor Kadir Topbaş and Düzce Mayor Mehmet Keleş.
Erdoğan has said that mayors suffering from what he calls “metal fatigue” should quit their jobs before the AKP expels them or judicial action is filed against them.
Gökçek was elected as the mayor of Ankara in 1994 and joined the AKP in the early 2000s. He we reelected in Ankara in three consecutive elections in 2004, 2009 and 2014.",erol kaya,26-07-20 0:00,5e97712045d70b412e3bbb8e3e61682f84895deba4adff11f98e7a6233b397bf,0.655463592,"[{'score': 0, 'topic': 'None'}]","[{'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.4066934883594513, 'name': 'Recep Tayyip Erdoğan', 'topic': 'misconduct'}, {'sentiment': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.41882315278053284, 'name': 'Recep Tayyip Erdoğan', 'topic': 'bribery'}, {'sentiment': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.3753650188446045, 'name': 'Binali Yıldırım', 'topic': 'misconduct'}, {'sentiment': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.43291357159614563, 'name': 'Binali Yıldırım', 'topic': 'bribery'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.5287630558013916, 'name': 'Melih Gökçek', 'topic': 'misconduct'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.4488474726676941, 'name': 'Melih Gökçek', 'topic': 'bribery'}]","PM dismisses news of Ankara mayor resignation as ‘rumors’

Blacklisted Singapore shipping firm denies arms link to North Korea,www.straitstimes.com,https://www.straitstimes.com/business/blacklisted-singapore-shipping-firm-denies-arms-link-to-north-korea,24-07-15 19:22,"SINGAPORE (AFP) - A Singapore shipping firm blacklisted by the US government for allegedly supporting illicit arms shipments into North Korea strongly denied the allegation Friday and vowed to clear its name.
Senat Shipping and Trading Pte Ltd said it had ""for many years chartered North Korean vessels to operate on the global spot market"" but all these were legitimate commercial transactions.
""Senat wishes to stress that all its dealings were legal and involved commercial shipments of commodities on behalf of international commodity traders. These transactions have always been transparent and can survive any form of scrutiny,"" it said in a statement.
In imposing sanctions on Senat and its president, Leonard Lai, on Thursday, the US Treasury Department alleged that the company was providing ""extensive support"" to Ocean Maritime Management Company (OMMC), a North Korean firm that already was under sanctions.
The blacklist freezes any US assets held by Senat and Lai, and prohibits US citizens from conducting any transactions with them.
Chong Chon Gang, a ship operated by OMMC, was seized in July 2013 near the Panama Canal carrying undeclared Soviet-era weapons and fighter jets under thousands of sugar sacks. The cargo, which came from Cuba, was intended for North Korea.
The US Treasury Department on Thursday claimed that Senat provides support to OMMC by ""arranging the purchase, repair, certification, and crewing"" of ships for that company.
""Arms shipments transported by OMMC serve as a key resource for North Korea's ongoing proliferation activities. Sales from these shipments contribute to North Korea's other illicit programmes,"" said Adam Szubin, the Treasury's acting undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence.
Senat in its statement said that it had chartered the Chong Chon Gang on a regular basis but stressed that it was not the charterer at the time the vessel was intercepted in Panama.

"Atlantic City, New Jersey, Man Admits Insurance Fraud, Drug Distribution",www.justice.gov,https://www.justice.gov/usao-nj/pr/atlantic-city-new-jersey-man-admits-insurance-fraud-drug-distribution,16-04-19 16:50,"CAMDEN, N.J. – An Atlantic City, New Jersey, man today admitted to staging a fake robbery of a Union County, New Jersey, pawnshop for the purpose of perpetrating an insurance fraud and to distributing illegal drugs, U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito announced.
Salvatore “Sam” Piccolo, 67, of Atlantic City, a member of the Philadelphia La Cosa Nostra organized crime family, pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Robert B. Kugler in Camden federal court to an information charging him with distribution 216 grams of methamphetamine and one count of wire fraud.
According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
Piccolo admitted that on April 19, 2014, he and an accomplice entered a pawnshop in Union County, purportedly to sell some silver items. Once inside the shop, the accomplice displayed a hand gun while Piccolo, wearing a nylon mask, chained the front doors closed to prevent anyone from entering. The owner was bound, as a pretense, while Piccolo and his accomplice looted the safe of what the owner told police was approximately $60,000 in cash, several pieces of jewelry, and a hand gun. The owner later submitted to his insurance company a fraudulent loss claim that was paid for approximately $174,000.
Piccolo also admitted making three sales of methamphetamine totaling 216 grams of the drug to an undercover FBI agent. Subsequent laboratory analysis determined the methamphetamine to be 99 percent pure.
The distribution of methamphetamine charge carries a minimum of 10 years in prison and a maximum penalty of life in prison; the wire fraud charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. Both counts are also punishable by a fine of $250,000. Sentencing is scheduled for July 18, 2019.
U.S. Attorney Carpenito credited special agents of FBI, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Gregory W. Ehrie in Newark, with the investigation leading to today’s guilty plea.

Tory MP Owen Paterson's wife found dead near family home,www.dailymail.co.uk,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8454823/Tory-MP-Owen-Patersons-wife-dead-family-home.html,24-06-20 11:18,"Advertisement
The racing executive wife of Tory MP Owen Paterson greeted neighbours and appeared in good health on her daily horse ride just hours before she was found dead in woodland close to their Shropshire mansion on her husband's 64th birthday, MailOnline can reveal.
Mr Paterson, a former cabinet minister under David Cameron and Conservative MP for North Shropshire, said the loss of his wife, Rose, 63, had come as a 'terrible shock' to the family.
Mrs Paterson, the daughter of the fourth Viscount Ridley, was the chairman of Aintree Racecourse and a Jockey Club board member. The couple married in 1980 and had two sons, Ned and Felix, and a daughter, Evie.
Mr Paterson said today: 'It is with great sadness that I must inform you that my wife, Rose, has been found dead at our family home in Shropshire. Rose and I were married for 40 happy years. She was a wonderful, caring wife, mother and grandmother. Her death has come as a terrible shock to us all'.
Mrs Paterson was seen as recently as yesterday lunchtime, when she appeared to be in good health and spirits with no hint of the tragedy that would follow hours later, a neighbour told MailOnline.
She said: 'My mum saw her on her horse yesterday about midday. They exchanged hellos, there was nothing remarkable about it. Overnight, about 1am, my mother heard the police helicopter over head. She was found a short distance from here.' Another neighbour said she heard police cars driving to and from the property until about 2.30am. She said: 'We were woken up by the police helicopter and saw police cars racing past on the main road outside'.
A police helicopter was hovering over the area around the family home and surrounding estate for several hours while they were 'searching for her' overnight, a close friend said, adding: 'We are still in shock. We've had a very sleepless night. She was a wonderful person with such a welcoming smile.'
West Mercia Police said the death was currently being treated as unexplained. A spokesman said: 'We can confirm the body of a woman has been found in woodland. At this stage there is believed to be no third party involvement'. She added the body was found in the 'early hours of this morning'.
Rose Paterson's death came as she became embroiled in a planning row alongside housing secretary Robert Jenrick, who has asked his department to re-examine an application by the Jockey Club for 300-plus homes and a hotel at Sandown Park, after it had been unanimously rejected by Surrey councillors last year. His intervention has raised concerns about conflicts of interest because of the Jockey Club's links to senior Conservative figures including Mrs Paterson, who sits on the club's board. No final decision has been made.
She married the MP in 1980 while Mr Paterson was working for the family's luxury leather business where he worked for more than 20 years before being elected to Parliament in 1997. He has led various leather and tannery trade associations and on top of his MP's salary he has made tens of thousands a year from consultancy work for food, healthcare and scientific companies. In 2017 he was the 12th highest earning MP based on earnings outside Parliament.
His wife was the second daughter of Matthew White Ridley, the 4th Viscount Ridley, who died in 2012, whose title was then handed down to his only son, also called Matthew. Since 1698 the family's seat has been the grand Blagdon Estate in Northumberland where Mrs Paterson grew up.

It is not known if Mrs Paterson had health problems, but in March Mr Paterson revealed they both came down with coronavirus and spent 15 days in quarantine together but despite feeling 'very groggy', the MP said they recovered.
The Patersons moved into their home four years after they got married. Neighbour Mr Chubbe said: 'I think the children now all work in London but came back here for the Covid lockdown. I don't know who is sting there now.'
Rachel Mottram, 65, a local farmer with two children and two grandchildren, said: 'It is so sad, such a shock. She was a lovely lady - she was a true lady.
'It is so sad for everyone on the district. She used to regularly ride past the farm on her horse and there was always a smile and a greeting'.
Another woman said: 'We only heard the helicopters last night.
'They started flying over head at about 11.30pm. My partner heard from a friend they were searching for her.'
Richard Clubbe, 72, an ex police officer and grandfather, said: 'They've been here as long as I've been here - 36 years. Everyone round here knows them. I knew her just in passing as she went by on her horse.
'We wouldn't talk about anything in depth, just things like her woods. She cared a lot about the countryside. She used to maintain the nature in her woods and strim the grass.
'I'm devastated. I couldn't believe it. It could've been anything. She was always very friendly. She was a lovely pleasant woman. She and Owen were very close. They were always together.
'Owen doesn't ride much, but they often used to walk together. They were generous. They took in four horse from Liverpool that had nowhere to go because of Covid. They put them on their land free of charge.
'They rode the Mongolian rally on their horse to raise thousands of pounds for an orthopaedic hospital and the Irish Regiment because Owen was Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.
'They were excellent neighbours. I never had a problem with them.
'I was Owen's key holder for 30 years. I used to go up there if an alarm went off when they weren't in. Their children were also very friendly when they were home.
'It's going to be a big loss to the area.'
Rose was appointed Chairman of Aintree in 2014, having been a Racecourse Committee Director at the famous home of the Randox Health Grand National since 2005. She was appointed a Steward of The Jockey Club in 2019.

'The PM heard the news this morning and has written to Owen.
'His thoughts and every sympathy are with Owen, his children and grandchildren at this difficult time,' a spokesman said.
Paying tribute, Sandy Dudgeon, Senior Steward of The Jockey Club, said: 'This is tragic news and our thoughts go out to Rose's husband Owen and all members of her family.
'Rose was a wonderful person and involved in so many aspects of our sport. She was a skilled Chairman at Aintree, a valued member of our Board of Stewards and headed up our Horse Welfare Group. She also enjoyed participating at grassroots level over many years.
'We appreciated her contribution very much and my fellow Stewards and I looked forward to hearing her sound views on a subject, where she was always sensitive to the best course of action for racing. She will be missed greatly for the person she was.'

Felix, a former student at Dublin's Trinity College, is a keen traveller who has posted pictures of his trips away online.
Ned, a global marketing manager at drinks brand Pernod Ricard, also lives in London. He studied Spanish and French at Durham University but went to school in Shrewsbury.
Mrs Paterson was in the news this week after Housing Minister Robert Jenrick was facing questions over a second planning row, involving the Jockey Club, of which she is on the board.
Mr Jenrick has called in an application for it to build 318 homes and a hotel at Sandown Park in Esher, Surrey. Its board includes Tory peer Baroness Harding, who oversees the Government's coronavirus test and trace programme, Rose Paterson, and Peter Stanley, who last year donated £5,000 to Health Secretary Matt Hancock's constituency office in Newmarket, where the Jockey Club is based.

Josef Schulz,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Schulz,11-01-11 19:15,"German soldier of the 714th Infantry Division
Josef Schulz (1909 or 1910, in Barmen – 20 July 1941, in Balkans, Serbia) also spelled Joseph Schultz (Serbian: Јозеф Шулц), was a German soldier of the 714th Infantry Division stationed in the Balkans, specifically Serbia, during World War II. He died in 1941, allegedly executed after refusing to take part in a partisan execution. The German High Command recorded him as killed in action. The plot of the Yugoslav short movie Joseph Schultz (1973) is based on the incident. Based on a Bundesarchiv study, the incident was dismissed as a legend by many scholars in the 1990s.
Life [ edit ]
Josef Schulz was a German soldier. He was born in 1909[citation needed] and lived in Barmen,[1] Wuppertal,[2] Germany. During World War II, he served as a corporal[1][2] in the 714th Infantry Division of the Wehrmacht.[3] He is officially recorded as having died during operations in Yugoslavia on 19 July 1941.[3]
Partisans' execution incident [ edit ]
On 20 July 1941, a Wehrmacht firing squad executed sixteen Yugoslav partisans within the barracks of Smederevska Palanka, southeast of Belgrade.[4] When the bodies of the victims were exhumed after the war, an eyewitness recalls that remains of military equipment ascribed to a German soldier were also recovered, while an identification tag got lost.[4] In 1947, when a memorial was erected for the victims, the name of a Croat victim with a German-sounding first name, Marsel Mezic, was rendered to Marcel Masel to reflect the belief that a German soldier was executed along with the partisans for refusing to take part in the executions.[4]
[5] is disputed.[3] Picture showing an execution of Yugoslav partisans on 20 July 1941. The identification of the person without helmet as Josef Schulzis disputed.
In 1961 and 1966, West German weeklies Neue Illustrierte and Quick published photographs dated to 20 July 1941, showing an execution and, probably, a German soldier without helmet and belt walking toward the line of the victims.[4] The German public was asked to identify this person.[4] The photographs were shot by Wehrmacht units, developed by a Palanka local and left behind when the unit was relocated to the Eastern Front.[4] The Palanka chronicle also published the photographs, but without mentioning the defection of a German.[4]
In response to the German weeklies' appeal, West German Bundestag member Wilderich Freiherr Ostman von der Leye identified the person on the photographs as Josef Schulz.[4] He based his identification on the diary of Friedrich Stahl, commander of the 714th infantry division, which was made available to him by the Bundesarchiv's Military Archive in Freiburg, then headed by Stahl's son.[4] On Ostman's initiative, Josef's brother Walter Schulz travelled to Yugoslavia in 1972, and confirmed that the person in question was Josef Schulz.[4] In 1973, a journalist from the Yugoslav paper Politika visited Walter Schulz in Germany; afterwards, Yugoslav newspapers reported that Josef Schulz had been a capable artist and a member of an underground opposition to Hitler.[4] Zvonimr Janković, a Yugoslav eyewitness, confirmed that he had seen a German officer arguing furiously with a German without insignia on his uniform.[4]
In contrast, some of Josef Schulz's former Wehrmacht comrades said that the person on the photographs was not Schulz.[4] A 1972 report of the Central Office of the State Justice Administration for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes in Ludwigsburg, Germany, also rejected the person's identification with Schulz.[4] Studies conducted by the staff of the Ludwigsburg office and the Freiburg Military Archive conclude that Josef Schulz was killed already on 19 July 1941[2][3][4] during an engagement with partisans,[2][3] and that he was reported dead to the army command on 20 July 2:00 AM, with a respective notice sent to the relatives subsequently.[4] Many scholars have since dismissed Schulz's alleged role in the incident on 20 July as a legend.[2][3]
Schulz nevertheless remained a popular figure in Yugoslavia, despite protests from a veteran partisan organization.[4] In the early 1980s, a second memorial was erected at the execution site in Palanka, where Schulz's name was added to those of the sixteen Yugoslav victims and the name of Marsel Mezic appears in its proper spelling.[4] While the Schulz legend is not as popular in Germany, West German ambassadors Horst Grabert and Wilfried Gruber attended ceremonies in Palanka in 1981 and 1997, respectively.[4]
Movie [ edit ]
In 1973, Yugoslav Zastava Films released the short movie Joseph Schultz. The plot is based on Schultz's refusal to execute Yugoslav partisans and his eventual execution by the firing squad he was assigned to. The 13 minutes long 16 mm sound and color movie was directed by Danko Popovic and Predrag Golubic. Original sepia photographs were combined with a re-enactment of the incident. In Canada and the United States, the movie was distributed by Wombat Productions, New York City.[6][7]
The movie was recommended as a resource for teaching by the US-based Educational Film Library Association (EFLA)[7] and by a Torah Aura Productions teachers' guide, Teaching the Holocaust.[8]

Iran says missile attacks to bases in Iraq 'did not intend to kill',www.washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/missile-strike-on-us-bases-did-not-intend-to-kill-says-iranian-commander/2020/01/09/c5c2295c-3260-11ea-971b-43bec3ff9860_story.html,09-01-20 13:57,"“We did not intend to kill,” said Brig. Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the head of the Revolutionary Guard’s Aerospace Force, according to Iranian state media. “We intended to hit the enemy’s military machinery.”
However, he repeated the government’s claim that “tens of people were killed or wounded.” U.S. and Iraqi officials said the strikes caused no casualties.
AD
Iran and the United States had been on a war footing since President Trump approved the killing last week of Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, the commander of the Revolutionary Guard’s elite expeditionary Quds Force and Iran’s most prominent military leader. Iran retaliated with the missile strike. By Wednesday, Iranian officials were suggesting that Iran did not intend any further attacks, and Trump said he would not respond militarily to the Iranian strikes.
AD
Trump administration officials have offered conflicting justifications for the killing of Soleimani, saying he was targeted to avert an “imminent” threat and otherwise to retaliate against Iranian aggression more generally. Trump, speaking at the White House on Thursday, said that “we did it because they were looking to blow up our embassy.”
It was not clear whether he was referring to previously undisclosed intelligence or to the storming of the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad by supporters of an Iranian-backed Iraqi militia a few days before Soleimani was killed.
AD
“We did it for other reasons that are very obvious,” Trump added, mentioning the killing of a U.S. contractor in a missile strike on Dec. 27.
“We didn’t start it. They started it by killing one of our people and wounding badly other of our people,” Trump said. “So that you call retribution.”
AD
A senior defense official on Thursday said the imminent nature of the attacks Soleimani was planning can be debated.
The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss U.S. military operations and intelligence, said there was a history of escalating violence attributed to Soleimani and the Quds Force over time. He described killing Soleimani as a proportionate response to Iran’s aggression and that the administration had considered other options that would have resulted in more casualties. The official didn't elaborate on what those options were.
AD
The official also said, however, that Trump’s claim about the nature of the threat at the embassy were true. He did not say how officials think Soleimani would have carried out such an attack.
The soaring tensions had alarmed officials in Iraq, the main stage for the conflict between Tehran and Washington, and spooked governments throughout the region.
AD
Rocket attacks in Baghdad late Wednesday showed that the risk of escalation remained. The strikes highlighted fears that Iraqi militias, backed by Iran, could pursue revenge for the killing of one of their leaders in the same attack that killed Soleimani.
Two rockets struck Baghdad’s Green Zone, which hosts the U.S. Embassy and other foreign diplomatic missions, but caused no injuries, Iraqi authorities said.
AD
Jawad al-Talibawi, a spokesman for the network of Iraqi militias known as the Hashd al-Shaabi, or Popular Mobilization Forces, told the Iraqi News Agency that the network was not responsible for the attack.
“The bombing of the Green Zone might be an individual reaction, or an attempt by some parties to distort the reputation of the Hashd and shuffle the cards,” he said. “We are calling on those behind the bombing to stop these actions that distort the reputation of Hashd factions.”
AD
The statement was part of the broader effort to de-escalate tensions, but “we should all take a moment before popping the champagne,” Rand Corporation political scientist Ariane M. Tabatabai said in an email. Even as the violence abated, the Trump administration was “doubling down on the maximum pressure campaign, which got us here to begin with,” she said, referring to U.S. sanctions and other measures aimed at isolating Iran.
AD
And Tehran, she added, could take further action. A tweet by Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif that his government had “concluded” its military response “could mean a lot of things: It could mean that Iran is done for now, which is the interpretation many have chosen to embrace. But it could also mean that this specific operation is done. Others may be in store.”
Iran tried to counter the United States on the diplomatic front Thursday after Trump called on Britain, Germany, France, Russia and China to “break away from the remnants” of the 2015 nuclear deal Iran struck with world powers. Trump withdrew the United States from the deal in 2018.
AD
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, speaking with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Thursday, “underlined the UK’s continued commitment to” the nuclear deal and “ongoing dialogue to avoid nuclear proliferation and reduce tensions,” according to a British government statement.
AD
Rouhani also called European Council President Charles Michel asking for a response to U.S. sanctions, which Rouhani described as “economic terrorism,” the Iranian Fars News agency reported.
In a statement, Michel emphasized the need for de-escalation in the region.
The tensions have continued to affect the main mission of U.S. forces in Iraq — fighting the Islamic State. The coalition said in a statement Thursday that military operations against the extremist group in Iraq would remain “paused” while the coalition focuses on “protecting the Iraqi bases that host Coalition personnel.”
AD
The conflict between the United States and Iran sparked concern that operations against the Islamic State, or ISIS, would be sidelined at a moment when the extremists, driven from the vast swath of territory they once held, are trying to regroup in parts of Iraq and Syria.
AD
In Iraq, hundreds of Islamic State fighters have made their way to rural areas in the north, stepping up their attacks in recent weeks, including ambushes and mortar strikes.
U.S. military officials first announced the suspension of anti-Islamic State operations Sunday, as the Trump administration braced for possible Iranian attacks on military bases hosting U.S. troops in Iraq.
The same day, Iraq’s prime minister urged parliament to take “urgent measures” to force the withdrawal of foreign forces after the killing of Soleimani.
AD
Lawmakers responded by passing a nonbinding resolution calling on the government to end the foreign troop presence in Iraq.
AD
The coalition’s statement Thursday said it was awaiting “further clarification on the legal nature and impact of the resolution on foreign troops no longer being allowed to stay in Iraq.” Its training and support of troops fighting the Islamic State has been suspended, although other activities, including countering the militant group’s propaganda, would continue, the statement said.",iran fahim,09-01-20 13:57,195dccd80efc4447123f2d2d6bdf609143a6f282e774487a9ea8762cae7294c3,0.783701272,"[{'score': 0.415371298789978, 'topic': 'assets'}, {'score': 0.4024168848991394, 'topic': 'sanctions'}, {'score': 0.4746928811073303, 'topic': 'cyber'}, {'score': 0.44978007674217224, 'topic': 'terrorism'}]","[{'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.5116649866104126, 'name': 'Javad Zarif', 'topic': 'sanctions'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.3802994191646576, 'name': 'Hassan Rouhani', 'topic': 'sanctions'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.4730331301689148, 'name': 'Boris Johnson', 'topic': 'sanctions'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.3660460412502289, 'name': 'Qasem Soleimani', 'topic': 'cyber'}, {'sentiment': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.3834325671195984, 'name': 'Qasem Soleimani', 'topic': 'terrorism'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.3565136194229126, 'name': 'Trump', 'topic': 'sanctions'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.3666864037513733, 'name': 'Trump', 'topic': 'terrorism'}, {'sentiment': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.5121460556983948, 'name': 'Trump', 'topic': 'cyber'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.4123201370239258, 'name': 'Charles Michel', 'topic': 'sanctions'}]","Gen.

Dawn CEO Hameed Haroon sends legal notice to filmmaker Jami,www.dawn.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1526632,05-01-20 0:00,"Dawn CEO Hameed Haroon, through his lawyer, sent a legal notice to filmmaker Jamshed Mahmood on Monday under Section 8 of the Defamation Ordinance 2002, asking for an unconditional public apology and retraction of rape allegations.
Talking to Dawn.com, the director, popularly known as Jami, said that he had received the notice and was in the process of reading through it. He added, however, that an apology was not ""even a distant possibility"".
“There is a lot that needs to be done for victims of sexual harassment and for future victims,” said Jami, who is currently in the United States. He also said that he had addressed many of the points raised in Haroon's notice in his previous posts on social media.
Taking to Twitter, he added: ""It is self-censorship that hurts me the most than allegations of me joining the establishment.""
Last year in October, Jami came forward with the accusation that he was raped by a “media tycoon” 13 years ago and on December 28, named Haroon as his alleged rapist.
In response, Haroon had issued a statement categorically rejecting the rape accusations and saying he would initiate legal action.
The four-page-long legal notice sent today, addressed to Jami's office in Karachi, refers to Jami's tweets from October 20, noting ""the alleged rapist was never specifically named, even though hints and innuendos were dropped from time to time that could conceivably be taken as suggesting that the alleged rapist was our client [Haroon]"".
Referring to the series of attacks on the Dawn Media Group in December, when a mob besieged Dawn Media’s offices in Islamabad and Karachi, the notice highlights that ""some members of this mob had pictures/posters of our client which made specific reference to the false rape allegations being made by you"".
""That almost two months after circulating your first tweet on being allegedly raped, and strangely and abruptly travelling outside Pakistan, on December 28, 2019 on the social media platform Twitter, you falsely and maliciously labelled our client as an alleged rapist.
""Since then, you have been continuing to circulate this false allegation all over Pakistan, including Karachi and abroad. Our client categorically denies that he has ever perpetrated sexual assault on anyone and categorically denies that he has raped you,"" says the notice.
""This false and malicious allegation has been levelled at the instigation of powerful interests in the state and society who, for their own motives and the promotion of their own repressive narrative, wish to destroy our client’s credibility, especially his credibility as a leading advocate of the freedom of the press.""
The notice terms the allegation ""a false statement [...] to injure the reputation"" of Haroon and says it aims to subject Haroon to ""ridicule, unjust criticism, dislike, contempt and hatred and to target the freedom of the press"".
The notice says that unless Jami circulates an unconditional public apology and issues a public statement retracting his allegation of rape from all social media posts and other media outlets within 14 days of the receipt of this notice, Haroon reserves the right to initiate civil and criminal legal proceedings against the director under Section 499 of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860, and the Defamation Ordinance, 2002, and other applicable laws.",jami jami,05-01-20 0:00,46b5d8903c36d6a80865597d6765cff9fc4b398bbc8ac6e01534ff4a034261a3,0.661298388,"[{'score': 0.4152078628540039, 'topic': 'embezzlement'}, {'score': 0.5486421585083008, 'topic': 'misconduct'}, {'score': 0.413860559463501, 'topic': 'terrorism'}, {'score': 0.4124334752559662, 'topic': 'bribery'}]","[{'sentiment': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.5151658058166504, 'name': 'Hameed Haroon', 'topic': 'misconduct'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.4602889120578766, 'name': 'Hameed Haroon', 'topic': 'terrorism'}, {'sentiment': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.4416871964931488, 'name': 'Jami', 'topic': 'misconduct'}]","Dawn CEO Hameed Haroon, through his lawyer, sent a legal notice to filmmaker Jamshed Mahmood on Monday under Section 8 of the Defamation Ordinance 2002, asking for an unconditional public apology and retraction of rape allegations.

Turkish Gyro,turkishnewsanalysis.blogspot.com,https://turkishnewsanalysis.blogspot.com/,03-08-07 0:00,"Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan: �We will never make concessions from the basic principles of the republic. We will pursue economic and democracy reforms with determination�
Turkey�s Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party is gearing up for its second five-year term in office after winning a landslide victory in legislative elections. It was a moment of triumph for Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who had called early elections on July 22 after his party was blocked from electing one of its own as president in April amid a secularist campaign accusing his AK party of seeking to erode Turkey�s secular system. The governing party, which has its roots in a now-banned Islamist movement, won 46.3 percent of the vote, leading its closest rival by a wide margin, according to unofficial results after 99.9 percent of the ballots were counted.
It was the largest support a Turkish party had gained since the 1969 legislative elections.
Erdogan faced the worst crisis of his career in April when the opposition boycotted a parliamentary vote in which his right-hand man, Foreign Minister Abdallah Gül, was almost certain to be elected president.
The crisis climaxed as the influential army warned in a stiff statement that it stood ready to step in to protect the secular system and millions of Turks took to the streets to demonstrate against the prospect of an AKP president.
The army has toppled four governments since 1960.
“The result shows that the people do not blame political tensions on the AKP”, political commentator Taha Akyol said. “The people have now authorized the AKP to elect the next president”.
The vote is “the people’s memorandum” to the army to stay out of politics, veteran journalist Hasan Cemal commented.
The AKP has disowned its roots, pledged commitment to secularism and carried out far-reaching economic and democracy reforms that ensured the start of Turkey’s European Union membership talks in 2005.
It has dismissed the opposition’s accusations that it has a secret Islamist agenda as “scare-mongering” to curb the party’s rising popularity.
Erdogan’s campaign focused on his party’s impressive economic achievements.
His government has drastically reduced inflation, maintained strong growth and attracted record foreign investment with a strong privatization drive.
It has also won credibility for easing access to medical care, providing free textbooks for schoolchildren and building cheap lodgings for the poor.
“The AKP’s economic success was the key factor in its victory”, commented economist Eser Karakas. “The army’s warning [that the secular system was under threat] was not taken seriously”.
The support the AKP garnered should translate into 339 seats in the 550-member Parliament, enough for it to once again form a government on its own.
The party had 352 members in the outgoing house and even though support for it increased by 12 percentage points compared to 2002, the number of its seats will decline because more parties will be represented in the legislature.
The main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP), a secularist party, finished second with 20.9 percent of vote and an estimated 112 seats, according to unofficial results. The right-wing Nationalist Action Party (MHP) was third with 14.2 percent and 71 seats.
No other party passed the 10-percent national threshold needed to enter Parliament, but 28 independent candidates won seats, 24 of them Kurds campaigning for broader rights for their sizeable community.
As soon as the new Parliament opens, its first task will be to elect a new president.
Erdogan has said he will seek a compromise in the presidential election, but insists that the candidate must be from his party.
The ‘evolution’ of ex-Islamists
Erdogan’s stunning victory in the polls has firmly placed his party at the center of Turkish politics -- a rare example of a radical Islamist movement evolving into a democratic force, analysts say.
“Rather than Islamization, we saw an Islamist-rooted party entrenching itself in the democratic tradition of the right”, commented Nilufer Gole, a professor of sociology and an expert on Islamist movements.
“This is a success for Turkey’s pluralist parliamentary system. This could well be an example of the evolution of a radical Islamist movement”.
Turkish newspapers said Erdogan’s success also signalled a public backlash against the military, which threatened the government in April over the AKP’s intention to install one of its members as president.
Erdogan was forced to bring elections forward from November after the opposition boycotted the parliamentary vote to elect the next head of state and the army told the government it would intervene to preserve secularism if need be.
But unlike past leaders who bowed to military pressure, Erdogan faced up to the generals, firmly reminding them that they remain under the orders of the prime minister.
“The first message from the ballot boxes is that the people stood by their democratic choice”, the daily Milliyet said.
“The nation has had the last word”, the moderate Islamist Zaman said.
Erdogan was once a religious firebrand who, as mayor of Istanbul, banned alcohol at municipal cafes, urged Turks to choose between Islam and secularism and served jail time for religious sedition.
But in a dramatic turnaround in 2001, the charismatic 53-year-old and his dissident colleagues in a now-banned Islamist party created the AKP, describing themselves as conservative democrats and pledging allegiance to secularism.
The AKP rode to office on its own as an untested party in the 2002 elections, when voters punished center-right and center-left parties for the country’s worst recession since World War II.
Since then, the AKP government has won kudos from the business community for reducing chronic inflation, maintaining high growth and enacting several democracy reforms that allowed it launch membership talks with the European Union in 2005.
“The AKP has embraced all sections of society. Business leaders are voting for the AKP, but so are their workers”, the political commentator Fatih Altayli said.
That kind of support differs largely from past Islamist parties, which relied mainly on pious voters in rural areas and ignored the urban educated classes.
Unofficial results show that one of two voters chose the AKP, allowing it to win even in constituencies that are traditionally seen as center-left or nationalist strongholds, analysts say.
“Since the 1950s, people have voted for change and renovation, not the status quo. There is nothing more to say in the light of what the AKP has achieved in the past five years”, former Parliament Speaker Hikmet Cetin said.
Pledge of reform
“Our democracy has successfully passed a test.... Our unity, democracy and the republic have emerged stronger from the ballot box”, Erdogan told cheering supporters outside party headquarters under a shower of fireworks.
“We will never make concessions from the basic principles of the republic. We will pursue economic and democracy reforms with determination”, Erdogan said, pledging also commitment to the secular system and Turkey’s EU membership bid.
That reform program was also stressed by the European Union, with officials holding out the carrot of membership if it was pursued.
But French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who has vocally opposed Turkey joining the EU, showed no indication of changing position, even as he telephoned Erdogan to welcome “his remarkable victory”.
He hoped “our relations of trust will continue despite the divergences France and Turkey may have”, according to a spokesman.
The prospect of a new government with a strong mandate for its business- and EU-friendly policies sent Turkish shares to a record high, closing five percent up.
The polls were largely seen as a litmus test for the future of democracy in the country after the abortive presidential election.
Turkish newspapers were nearly unanimous in ascribing the AKP’s success in large part to a public rejection of military meddling in democratic politics.
“The people do not like governments that quarrel with the soldiers, but the people also do not like military intervention”, the mass-circulation Hurriyet said.
EU leaders urge redoubling of reform efforts
European Union officials welcomed the AKP’s resounding electoral win and urged the country to push ahead with reforms that could lead to EU membership.
European newspapers called the result of the vote a sharp rebuke to the secular military and a turning point for the nation’s democracy.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn urged Turkey to redouble its efforts on European Union-oriented reform.
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said the vote came “at an important moment for the people of Turkey as the country moves forward with political and economic reforms”.
The commission’s vice president, Franco Frattini, told Italian newspapers there was an “equilibrium” in the vote results that staved off “the risk of an extremist drift”.
Turkey was made an official candidate to join the European Union in October 2005 but its long quest to join Europe’s 27-country club has been dogged by problems.
The EU froze talks in December with Turkey on eight of the 35 policy areas, or chapters, that all aspiring members must complete because of Ankara’s ongoing trade dispute with Cyprus.
Some chapters have since been reopened.
The Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant called the election “a clear no to the military”, commenting that “Turkish voters have grown weary of the old political class that has proclaimed itself guardian of the country”.
In France, the right-wing Le Figaro said the vote was “a turning point in modern Turkish history. The country can now look for new ways to try to reconcile the un-reconcilable: secularism and religion”.
The center-left daily Der Tagesspiegel in Germany, which has a large Turkish population, said Erdogan had won a clear mandate to press forward with his drive to bring Turkey closer to the European Union.
“Despite the increased Europe-scepticism of the Turks, it is a clear signal”, it wrote in a front-page editorial. “Europe must get prepared for the Turks to knock harder on the door of the EU soon”.
Sweden’s Dagens Nyheter daily agreed, saying Erdogan “can now follow through on his prudent political reforms” leading Turkey toward the European Union.
In neighboring Greece, newspapers spoke of changes in relations between the two rivals.
“The new Turkish political scene hides traps that demand we adapt our policies”, the left-leaning Ta Nea wrote in an editorial.
Greek Prime Minister Constantin Caramanlis congratulated Erdogan on his election victory and, in a clear reference to Cyprus, said he hoped it would contribute to Turkey “fulfilling all the obligations” for EU membership.
Dutch Foreign Ministry spokesman Robert Dekker told reporters he hoped the new government would continue with reforms “important for the development of democracy and membership of the European Union”.
In Israel, foreign ministry spokesman Mark Regev said: “Israel looks forward to continue expanding our relationship of cooperation and friendship with Turkey.”
Turkey has been a key ally of Israel since 1996 when the two countries signed a military cooperation deal, much to the anger of Arab countries and Iran.
Gül looks towards the Presidency
Gul hinted strongly last week that he could run for president again after his party’s victory.
Asked whether he would be a candidate again when the new Parliament meets next month for a fresh presidential vote, he told reporters that his decision was “very clear”, but declined to elaborate.
“I cannot be expected to ignore the will of the people... the signs given at the rallies,” he said, referring to supporters who cheered him as a future president at election campaign rallies.
But he stressed that “there is no need to rush things,” saying the process must continue “with great political maturity in the direction indicated by the results” of the election.
“We have a period of evaluation ahead of us... I believe the other parties in parliament will carefully consider the nearly 50 percent of the vote that we obtained”.
The main opposition Republican People’s Party, a key player in the April crisis, quickly responded that Gul’s Islamist past remained an insurmountable obstacle to his election as head of state.
“We will not support a person who comes from [a radical Islamist] tradition and who has not embraced Ataturk’s principles”, said CHP deputy chairman Mustafa Ozyurek, referring to Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey.
Secularists take special exception to the fact that Gül’s wife always wears a headscarf in public, which she would presumably continue to do if her husband was elected. They complain that the presence in the presidential palace of someone wearing a religious symbol would be in flagrant contradiction to the country secular tradition.
If Gül is again put up as a candidate, Ozyurek said his party would again boycott the presidential vote.
The third party that entered Parliament, the Nationalist Action Party, as well as 28 independents, had not yet said whether they will support Gül.
Opponents charge that with Gul in the presidential palace, the AKP will have a free hand to advance what some see as the party’s hidden policy of eroding the separation between state and religion.
Outgoing President Ahmet Necdet Sezer, a hard-line secularist, often vetoed laws he deemed anti-secular and blocked the appointment of senior officials he saw as Islamist government cronies.
And lingering suspicions about the party have been fuelled by its opposition to a headscarf ban in universities and public offices, its encouragement of religious schools and failed attempts to restrict alcohol sales and make adultery a jailable offense.",şevket adalan,03-08-07 0:00,82c22bd3de70928caa543c905d280d63593f90645f493b27bde5cb5468d7fc8f,0.663858223,"[{'score': 0, 'topic': 'None'}]","[{'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.42311668395996094, 'name': 'Recep Tayyip Erdogan', 'topic': 'corruption'}, {'sentiment': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.5438540577888489, 'name': 'Islamist Zaman', 'topic': 'terrorism'}]","Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan: �We will never make concessions from the basic principles of the republic. We will pursue economic and democracy reforms with determination�
Turkey�s Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party is gearing up for its second five-year term in office after winning a landslide victory in legislative elections. The governing party, which has its roots in a now-banned Islamist movement, won 46.3 percent of the vote, leading its closest rival by a wide margin, according to unofficial results after 99.9 percent of the ballots were counted. Erdogan faced the worst crisis of his career in April when the opposition boycotted a parliamentary vote in which his right-hand man, Foreign Minister Abdallah Gül, was almost certain to be elected president. The crisis climaxed as the influential army warned in a stiff statement that it stood ready to step in to protect the secular system and millions of Turks took to the streets to demonstrate against the prospect of an AKP president. The army has toppled four governments since 1960. His government has drastically reduced inflation, maintained strong growth and attracted record foreign investment with a strong privatization drive. “The AKP’s economic success was the key factor in its victory”, commented economist Eser Karakas. “ Turkish newspapers said Erdogan’s success also signalled a public backlash against the military, which threatened the government in April over the AKP’s intention to install one of its members as president.

South Dakota’s governor resisted ordering people to stay home. Now it has one of the nation’s largest coronavirus hot spots.,www.msn.com,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/south-dakotas-governor-resisted-ordering-people-to-stay-home-now-it-has-one-of-the-nations-largest-coronavirus-hot-spots/ar-BB12zTcc,26-07-20 0:00,"As governors across the country fell into line in recent weeks, South Dakota’s top elected leader stood firm: There would be no statewide order to stay home.
Such edicts to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus, Gov. Kristi L. Noem said disparagingly, reflected a “herd mentality.” It was up to individuals — not government — to decide whether “to exercise their right to work, to worship and to play. Or to even stay at home.”
And besides, the first-term Republican told reporters at a briefing this month, “South Dakota is not New York City.”
But now South Dakota is home to one of the largest single coronavirus clusters anywhere in the United States, with more than 300 workers at a giant ­pork-processing plant falling ill. With the case numbers continuing to spike, the company was forced to announce the indefinite closure of the facility Sunday, threatening the U.S. food supply.

“A shelter-in-place order is needed now. It is needed today,” said Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken, whose city is at the center of South Dakota’s outbreak and who has had to improvise with voluntary recommendations in the absence of statewide action.
But the governor continued to resist. Instead, she used a media briefing Monday to announce trials of a drug that President Trump has repeatedly touted as a potential breakthrough in the fight against the coronavirus, despite a lack of scientific evidence.
“It’s an exciting day,” she boasted, repeatedly citing her conversations with presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner.

The piecemeal approach to combating the coronavirus in South Dakota offers a throwback to America’s not-so-distant past, the period around a month ago when governors were still leery of using their powers to shut down restaurants and bars or to order people, for the greater good, to stay at home.
It also may offer a glimpse of the country’s near-term future, as pressure builds — not least from the president — to reopen after a weeks-long shutdown. Trump has been eager to get the economy on its feet again by the beginning of May after record rises in unemployment claims and dramatic falls in the stock market.
Yet as South Dakota’s experience shows, no part of the country is immune to being ravaged by the virus. And rescinding orders that people stay at home — or declining to issue them, as in the case of South Dakota and four other states — offers plenty of peril.
Reopening the country by May is “not even remotely achievable,” said TenHaken, who, like Trump and Noem, is a Republican. “We’re in the early innings of this thing in Sioux Falls.”
Already, the experience has been harrowing: As of early April, the city had relatively few cases. But over the course of last week, the numbers surged as the virus ripped through the city’s Smithfield Foods production plant, a colossus that employs 3,700 people — many of them immigrants — and churns out 18 million servings of pork product per day.
On Monday alone, 57 more workers were confirmed to have positive diagnoses, bringing the total well above 300 — and making it one of the country’s largest clusters . Other major clusters include Cook County Jail in Chicago and the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier.
The Smithfield cases amount to more than a third of the state’s overall total, which stood at 868 on Monday, including six deaths, in a state of nearly 900,000 people.
Over the weekend, Smithfield bowed to growing pressure and said it would shutter the facility indefinitely in a bid to contain the spread — though Smithfield leaders cautioned that the action could severely disrupt the nation’s food supplies. The factory, like other food production facilities, had earlier been deemed essential by the federal government.
The shutdown of the Sioux Falls plant, coupled with other closures, “is pushing our country perilously close to the edge in terms of our meat supply,” Kenneth Sullivan, Smithfield president and chief executive, said in a statement. “It is impossible to keep our grocery stores stocked if our plants are not running.”
Before the closure, workers had complained that they were not given sufficient access to protective gear, such as masks. The company said Thursday that it had taken steps to reduce the spread, including “adding extra hand sanitizing stations, boosting personal protective equipment, continuing to stress the importance of personal hygiene.” But workers said they were required to work so closely together that it was impossible to stay healthy.
“There is no social distance,” said Lily, a 30-year-old Mexican immigrant who had worked at the plant for nearly 13 years but quit because she feared bringing the coronavirus home to her husband and young daughter.
Lily, who spoke on the condition that her last name not be published for fear of retribution, said it is not only at work where she feared the virus. “Many people are sick. Not only in the plant — in the whole city,” she said.
Sioux Falls, home to nearly 200,000 people, is the state’s largest city. TenHaken, the mayor, said in an interview that he has done everything within his power to enforce social distancing, including using a “no lingering” ordinance to confine restaurants to takeout and delivery service and strongly recommending that all nonessential businesses close.
He has little power of enforcement, however, and no ability to control what happens in nearby jurisdictions. Restaurants within Sioux Falls may have shut down for in-person dining, but the rules don’t apply outside city limits.
Without a more assertive response from state government — including stay-at-home orders in at least the surrounding counties and a declaration of a statewide public health emergency — TenHaken said he fears the spread will continue.
“The virus doesn’t know boundaries. The virus doesn’t know city limits,” he said. “We’re responding the best we can at the local level but quite honestly with a limited tool set.”
TenHaken’s plea for state action has also been made by public health professionals.
The South Dakota State Medical Association wrote Noem a letter April 3 warning the governor that the state “may soon face the challenges and hardships currently being seen in New York and other large cities across the country if a shelter in place order is not issued immediately.”
Noem is one of five governors representing relatively rural states — North Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska and Arkansas are the others — still resisting such calls. All are Republicans, and all have used similar justifications for going against the national grain.
In Arkansas, Gov. Asa Hutchinson has boasted of his state’s “very targeted response” and argued that other states have so many exemptions to their stay-at-home orders that they “override the rule.”
Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds has said that keeping people at home takes a toll on their mental health and that “suicides and domestic abuse” would rise.
Noem has perhaps gone even further than others, however, citing the principle of individual liberty and the limitations of government to dictate people’s behavior — even when public health may depend on it.
Citing scientific modeling, the governor acknowledged this month that up to 70 percent of residents in her state may ultimately fall ill with covid-19. But, she suggested, it wasn’t up to government to tell them how to behave.
“The people themselves are primarily responsible for their safety,” she said. “They are the ones that are entrusted with expansive freedoms.”
Noem on Monday continued to defend her approach, saying the state had high levels of voluntary participation in social distancing strategies — “much greater than some of those states that issued shelter-in-place orders.”
She also said that spikes in case numbers, such as the one at Smithfield, had been “expected” and that the state’s numbers overall were trending in the right direction.
Noem, who said she was closely coordinating with the White House, focused her remarks on a trial of hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malarial drug that President Trump has frequently touted as a possible remedy for the coronavirus, though its effectiveness has not been proved. Scientists in Brazil stopped a study of a similar drug in coronavirus patients after some developed irregular heart rates.
She batted away questions about a statewide stay-at-home order — or even countywide ones. But public health experts say such an order is what’s needed, even in a rural state such as South Dakota.

“In rural areas, there’s less access to health care,” said DenYelle Kenyon, director of the public health program at the University of South Dakota. “And all it takes is one case to spread to a small community.”
Front-line medical workers, too, have been outspoken in calling for the state to step up.
Amy Taylor, a Sioux Falls-based nurse who is married to a nurse practitioner, sat down one evening and spent 10 minutes tapping out a petition on Change.org demanding that Noem order people to stay home.
“I thought some friends might sign it,” Taylor said. “But it just kind of took off.”
The petition was closing in on 30,000 signatures as of Monday night. Many of the signers identify themselves as health-care workers.
“I just don’t understand why we aren’t doing everything we can to save people’s lives,” Taylor said.
More than 160 county and city leaders in South Dakota have also petitioned Noem, urging her to declare a statewide public health emergency.
Rapid City Mayor Steve Allender was among those who signed. As leader of the state’s second-largest city, he has instituted aggressive measures to keep people apart. But as is true in Sioux Falls, citywide efforts can only do so much when the state’s response is such a patchwork.
Now, economic pain from the shutdown is growing — and so is frustration that the city’s businesses have been closed while others nearby remain open. Without the state backing him up, Allender said, it will be tough to hold the line.
“There’s no political winners in this pandemic,” said Allender (R), whose city has seen relatively few cases. “You have to decide on which side of the argument you’re going to lose — the one that was too cautious or the one that was too reckless.”

"Kweisi Mfume Shares Personal Experience With Police Brutality, Outlines Legislative Priorities",baltimore.cbslocal.com,https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2020/06/22/kweisi-mfume-police-brutality-legislative-priorities-interview/,22-06-20 22:00,"BALTIMORE (WJZ) — He served in Congress from 1987 to 1996. Little did Kweisi Mfume know that 24 years later he would again return to Washington to occupy the very seat he left in Maryland’s 7th congressional district.
Mfume won a special election to replace the unexpired term of the late Rep. Elijah Cummings, who died in October at age 68.
That term, though, ends in January 2021, meaning Mfume is again running for Congress — this time as the incumbent.
In an exclusive interview with WJZ’s Vic Carter, the 71-year-old shared his priorities for his office and got personal talking about his experience with police brutality.
The sounds of protest are nothing new for Mfume; in fact, he has been on the front lines before. Now, he, like millions of other African American men in America, want to see serious change in policing.
Vic Carter: Can you describe a time when you feared for your life?
Kweisi Mfume: I got pulled over on East North Avenue where the municipal court is. It used to be the old Sears building at the time, a real bustling community, in the middle of the day, around 1:30 in the afternoon… (I) got pulled over, got snatched out of my car, got thrown up against the wall. I was told to spread eagle, got patted down and while the guy was patting me down the other one just came up to me and whispered all sorts of racial epithets in my ear, saying ‘I dare you to do anything. I dare you. Go ahead and make a move you monkey, you this, you that.’
As a powerful member of Congress, Mfume is a sponsor of the Justice in Policing Act of 2020.
The legislation bans racial and religious profiling, chokeholds and no-knock warrants. It also mandates the use of dash camera and body-worn camera video and would create a national registry of police officers charged with wrongdoing.
Mfume is not sure if President Donald Trump is on board with the legislation.
“This president is sort of slow to the party sometimes on major issues that affect people, and this issue of police brutality is at the top of the list of things that good, average, decent people are concerned about,” he said.
The congressman welcomed the newly-elected officials in Baltimore and said he hopes they will seek the advice of those who have been there.
“Just don’t walk into office because you got elected and know everything there is to know,” he said, “That’s a lot of blood, sweat and tears, it’s hard work, it’s failure, it’s success. And so to that extent, I’m hoping at least that many of the new elected officials will look at some of the older elected officials and say, ‘By the way, do you think I should be going right or going left?”
If he wins, Mfume has a long list of priorities, but at the top is controlling COVID-19.
“The first order of business is tackling this pandemic,” he said. “It has just devastated us. Four months ago, there were 60 Americans dead; today there are more than 116,000.”
Mfume will square off with Republican Kimberly Klacik in the November election.

Pak backing plan for another 9/11-type attack: Ex-Afghan spy chief (IANS EXCLUSIVE),www.outlookindia.com,https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/pak-backing-plan-for-another-911type-attack-exafghan-spy-chief-ians-exclusive/1837331,17-05-20 17:17,"Pak backing plan for another 9/11-type attack: Ex-Afghan spy chief (IANS EXCLUSIVE)
New Delhi/Islamabad, May 17 (IANS) Afghanistan''s former spy chief has warned that the Pakistan-backed Haqqani network (HQN) is helping banned Islamist terror group al-Qaeda to plan another 9/11-style terror attack against the West.
In a series of tweets posted on Sunday, the former director of Afghanistan''s National Directorate of Security (NDS), Rahmatullah Nabil revealed that al-Qaeda continues to be backed by the HQN based in Pakistan.
""If state sponsors of terrorism in the region are not stopped we will see another 9/11-style attack in future. Al-Qaeda''s al-Zawahiri, Abu Muhammad Al Masri and Saif ul Adel are still planning attacks in the West with the backing of the HQN which is based in Pakistan,"" he tweeted.
An offshoot of the Taliban, the HQN headed by Maulvi Jalaluddin''s son Sirajuddin Haqqani, is an Afghan Islamist terror group fighting against the US-led NATO forces and the democratically elected government of Afghanistan. The network in the 1980s was backed by the CIA during the Ronald Reagan administration to fight against the Soviets in Afghanistan.
Jalaluddin Haqqani for his network, recruited Arab national Osama bin Laden who later founded al-Qaeda with a pan-Islamic objective. Al-Qaeda remains closely associated with the HQN whose objective of establishing Islamic rule is restricted to Afghanistan.
The former director of NDS in a series of tweets on Sunday said, ""Sirajuddin Haqqani and his senior commanders are running the commission responsible for overlooking the foreign fighters.""
Yahya Haqqani is the overall liaison for the HQN with foreign fighters, Nabil said.
""From ETIP (East Turkistan Islamic Movement), AQIS (Al-Qaeda in Indian Subcontinent) to AQC (Al-Qaeda Central) all these are the strongest allies of HQN leadership, in particular Sirajuddin Haqqani and his hard boys which gives HQN leverage and control over the wider Taliban movement thus striking fear in those who oppose them in the movement,"" the Afghan security expert said.
Nabil revealed that Abdul Rauf Zakir also known as Qari Zakir, the chief of suicide operations of HQN with a bounty of five million dollars on his head, had been killed in a drone strike along with Hamza bin Laden (Osama''s son) in Ghuzguri area of Kurram Agency.
""The death of Hamza bin Laden was confirmed in September 2019 by US President Donald Trump. But no one talked about the place of his death and that he was together with Qari Zakir in Kurram Agency! Hamza bin laden was killed with Qari Zakir in the same drone strike,"" he tweeted.
The Taliban particularly HQN have never denounced al-Qaeda, the former NDS director pointed out.
""From the materials seized in Abbottabad to sheltering Farooq Al Qahtani in Kunar the intelligence communities know this very well. Intel sources are aware that the presence of AQIS and AQC is only strong in areas where HQN is present/active and these agencies are sitting on piles of evidence. We cannot ignore the elephant in the room,"" Nabil wrote while tagging US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and US President Donald Trump.

CMBC is making news!
This past week, Ryan sat in with Scott Cronick of Off the Press at WOND, discussing how COVID has affected Cape May Brewing Company, while Tasting Room General Manager Chris Costello and Cape Beverage Operations Manager Justin Vitti sat in with the guys from South Jersey Beer Scene.
South Jersey Beer Scene
John Couchoud and Tom Renzulli at South Jersey Beer Scene got together (virtually, of course) with Chris and Justin to talk about, well…, just about everything.
While Justin and Chris both sipped on a Key Lime Corrosion, Chris discussed our (extremely quick) pivot toward home delivery and Justin talked about the distribution explosion that happened for our canned beers.
John asked about some of our Tasting Room-only releases, like That Cherry Lime Good Good, and he mentioned that Follow the Gull is one of his favorite South Jersey beers.
But he was particularly complimentary toward the “phenomenon” of Crushin’ It. Jordan Crawford from Circle Liquors in Somers Point hopped on to say that Crushin’ It is absolutely flying off the shelves. That’s great news!
They discussed some of what’s in store for Cape Beverage and gave a little preview of Anniversary Ale 9, but the big takeaway is this:
Everybody loves Chris Martin.
Check it out!
Off the Press
Scott Cronick ran a great interview with Ryan, discussing a lot of the issues that are currently facing us.
Ryan pointed out that turning off 100% of keg sales definitely hurt us, but, while liquor stores are helping keep us afloat, they won’t be able to completely replace that revenue.
Because of that, we’re asking the federal government to postpone our excise taxes for the entire year. They’ve given us a three-month postponement of those taxes, which is great, but if the summer fails to launch as we feel it might, that bill will come due at exactly the worst time.
If you recall, CBMTRA reduced our excise taxes from $7-per-barrel to $3.50-per-barrel, which is certainly helping during this time; however, a little more help is necessary.
If you’d like to lend your voice, head over to the Beer Institute or the Brewers Association to petition your members of Congress.
“We’ll come out of this a stronger company and more thoughtful,” Ryan said.
Check out the video!
Local breweries, like many other businesses, are struggling. But did you know breweries pay more taxes than most other businesses? Here is Ryan Krill from Cape May Brewing Co. urging the federal government to suspend the excise tax for the whole year. You can help, too, but contacting Congressman Jeff Van Drew.

Tom Harkin says employment still an issue on 30th anniversary of ADA,www.desmoinesregister.com,https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/2020/07/23/americans-with-disabilities-act-30th-anniversary-former-senator-tom-harkin-proud-of-work-on-ada/3287353001/,22-07-20 0:00,"Former U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin can still recall the day his older brother Frank Harkin was taken away from their family home in Cumming.
Frank Harkin lost his hearing at the age of 5, Tom Harkin said, and at that time, the only place where he could get an education was more than two hours away in Council Bluffs at the Iowa School for the Deaf. Tom Harkin said state officials came one day and took his brother away from his family, community and all his friends so he could go to the school.
“That is very traumatic,"" Tom Harkin said. “And in those days, they always referred to it as the ‘Iowa School for the Deaf and Dumb.'
“I remember my brother one time told me, ‘I may be deaf, but I'm not dumb.’”
Frank Harkin would become the inspiration for one of Sen. Harkin’s proudest achievements — the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. As the Senate was about to adopt the groundbreaking ADA, Harkin, the author and chief sponsor, began his speech from the Senate floor in American sign language, becoming the first senator to do so.
“I wanted to do that as a special way of thanking a very special person in my life who taught me at a very young age that people with disabilities could do anything they set their minds to do,” Harkin said after his introduction in ASL.
“In sign language, I just wanted to say to my brother Frank that today was my proudest day in 16 years in Congress. That today, Congress opens the doors to all Americans with disabilities. That today, we say no to fear, that we say no to ignorance, and that we say no to prejudice.”
Since the ADA was signed into law 30 years ago, on July 26, 1990, the country has made significant changes in the way it treats people with disabilities.
Harkin said the biggest milestone has been changing Americans' attitudes about people with disabilities, treating them with dignity as opposed to pity and condescension.
“As I've often said in the past, the biggest barriers for people with disabilities are not the physical barriers they have, but the attitudinal barriers,” Harkin said. “The world before was a world of isolation for people with disabilities. It was a life of hurtful, demeaning language.
Another milestone, related to changing attitudes, was integrating people with disabilities into the public school system. As part of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1990, which Harkin also sponsored, students with disabilities were to be accommodated at their neighborhood schools. Unlike Harkin’s brother Frank, children with disabilities no longer had to leave their families and homes to receive an education.
Probably the most visible area of improvement has been changes to what he calls the “built environment,” which includes curb cuts, ramps, automatic door openers and accessible bathrooms. Additionally, telecommunications are now required to accommodate the deaf and blind with text-to-voice and voice-to-text, he said.
But in the areas of economic self-sufficiency and equal employment, Harkin says there is still a lot of work to be done.
“We’ve barely moved the needle,” he said. ""The unemployment rate for adults with disabilities today is about the same as it was 30 years ago.""
Roadblocks to equal opportunity employment
When Frank Harkin was about to graduate from the Iowa School for the Deaf, faculty told him he could become one of three things — a baker, a printer’s assistant or a shoe cobbler.
“He became a very good baker, but that's not what he wanted to do,” Tom Harkin said. With ADA legislation, the former senator wanted to open doors to all Americans with disabilities to find a job that they enjoyed.
According to the Bureau for Labor Statistics, the labor force participation rate for people with disabilities has hovered around 20% for the last 11 years. That's compared to nearly 70% for people without disabilities.
The main cause of the discrepancy, Tom Harkin said, was a trio of Supreme Court decisions made in 1999, known as the “Sutton Trilogy,” that severely limited the definition of the word “disability.”
“That put on hold what we were trying to do in terms of getting more employment opportunities,” Harkin said.
The decisions confused both employers and people with disabilities as to what their rights and responsibilities were under the ADA. Because fewer people qualified as having a disability under the court’s new definition, fewer people were eligible to file a discrimination claim against their employer under the ADA.
The 2008 ADA Amendments Act overturned the court’s decisions and allowed for a broader definition of the word “disability.” But the damage was already done, Harkin said. Rather than having 30 years to make progress in the realm of equal employment opportunity for people with disabilities, the country has had only 11 years.
“That held us up for 19 years,” he said.
Moving toward the ADA's goals
Since the ADA Amendments Act, Harkin says employer reluctance, a lack of outreach from human resource officers and some hesitation from people with disabilities has hindered progress on employment. Harkin said he has focused all of his disability advocacy efforts on employment since retiring in 2015.
""There is a company in central Iowa that I think is showing the way on this, and that's Hy-Vee,"" Harkin said. ""Hy-Vee does a great job of instilling, from the corporate level down to the store level, the requirement that they hire people with disabilities.""
Harkin said Hy-Vee has modified its training program to be more inclusive of those with disabilities, and they give people with disabilities opportunities to move beyond bagging groceries.
Until recently, Robert Fisher worked at Hy-Vee in Waukee as a stocker. He has quadriplegic cerebral palsy and type 1 diabetes and has used a wheelchair all his life. He said he was treated well by Hy-Vee customers, fellow employees and management during his time as a stocker.
""Unfortunately, I am out of work right now because of COVID-19,"" said Fisher, who lives with his parents in Adel. ""My mom does not want me to work right now.""
Fisher, who is also a member of the Iowa Developmental Disabilities Council, has worked with the city of Adel to make downtown streets more accessible to people who use mobility devices.
Fisher said he noticed that there weren’t very many people using walkers or wheelchairs downtown, which led him to realize there were no curb cuts or signal buttons to help navigate the crosswalks.
Brady Werger, another member of the Iowa Developmental Disabilities Council, said he wanted to use his voice to advocate for others with disabilities and help them find the resources and services they need.
The 28-year-old said he feels that people with disabilities are sometimes treated differently and that their disability goes unnoticed or is ignored by others.
“I try to advocate on their behalf and remind people, ‘If your disability is being ignored, don't give up on yourself, keep advocating for yourself.’”
When he was moving out of a Glenwood residential facility and into the community, Werger said he had to stand up for himself and insist that he was ready to live independently.
“A lot of problems that I ran into with my guardians and staff was that they said, ‘Oh, you're not ready. You're going to move out and fail,’” he said. “That’s when I advocated for myself and stepped up and said, ‘Don't say it like that. You don't know somebody is gonna fail until they try.’”
Frank Harkin inspired change
Frank Harkin died in 2000 from congestive heart failure and complications of prostate cancer. But he inspired landmark legislation that now allows young Americans with disabilities to grow up without being excluded from society.
Instead, they are participating in all kinds of activities like sports and politics that, 30 years ago, they wouldn't have been able to do, Tom Harkin said.
""The younger generation who have grown up under ADA, they don't take a backseat,"" he said. ""They're just not going to accept the old way of being isolated and hidden. They want to be included.""

New Harkin Institute building goes beyond ADA compliance
Just because a building meets the Americans with Disabilities Act's building standards does not necessarily make it accessible to everyone, said Kevin Nordmeyer, one of the lead architects for the new Harkin Institute for Public Policy & Citizen Engagement building at Drake University.
“The ADA is simply a baseline to try to get all buildings to a level of accessibility,” he said. What many buildings lack is what architects call ""universal inclusive design principles,"" or the concept of making spaces more usable to everyone by making them accessible to those with disabilities.
“What the design of the Harkin Institute has taught me and our team is that there's all of these other folks that aren't really addressed specifically by ADA building requirements,” Nordmeyer said.
The Harkin Institute was established at Drake University in 2013 to conduct public policy research and analysis of issues important to retired U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin, including labor and employment, people with disabilities, retirement security and nutrition. It also focuses on education and outreach surrounding these issues among students and the public.
The nonpartisan organization is on track to move into its new two-story, 16,000-square-foot building near the southwest corner of 28th Street and University Avenue this fall. The $8.5 million price tag has been covered by private donations.
Nordmeyer and the other lead architect, Jason Kruse, worked closely with the Harkin Institute’s Accessibility Committee throughout the design process. The first question Nordmeyer asked the committee members during the early stages was, “What kinds of barriers do you still face even though the ADA has been around for 30 years?”
No one had ever asked them that question before, they said, and that lack of dialogue was the problem. Committee members then started making recommendations, such as including high-contrast visuals and limiting distracting shadows to accommodate people with low vision. They told Nordmeyer about “deaf space” and how limiting glare of lights is important since those who are deaf rely on their eyes to orient themselves in their surroundings.
One suggestion was to design the two-story building without the need for an elevator to access the upper level. That way, no one was relegated to a “second class” method of moving between the floors.
Nordmeyer, who has multiple sclerosis, recently transitioned to using a motorized wheelchair most of the time and now has an even more personal appreciation for accessible design. He said people without disabilities take for granted how much planning it takes to figure out how to navigate a building that isn’t designed with accessibility as the main focus.
“If I have a meeting somewhere,” he said, “and I haven't been there before, I have to research in advance to figure out, ‘OK, where am I going to park? How do I get in?’ I'd have to allow an extra half hour just to get to a meeting where, before I was disabled, I could just get there just in time.”
Kruse said he and his colleagues have gained a greater appreciation for accessible design by watching Nordmeyer struggle to use and navigate certain spaces with his wheelchair.
“Before Kevin was fully in a wheelchair, before we took on this project, a lot of people, myself included, would just use those code minimums of, ‘OK, we have this clearance next to the door, boom, we can put a wall here and it's fine,” Kruse said. “But just providing 6 more inches, or even a few more inches, goes a long way to somebody that needs that little extra space to maneuver themselves through that doorway.”
Nordmeyer and Kruse have compiled their research on universal inclusive design from the Harkin project into a booklet that all firms can use to make future buildings more accessible — not just ADA-compliant. The recommendations include making hallways wide enough for two wheelchairs and holding meetings at round tables to better include those who read lips or use sign language. It’s still in draft stages.
“In a perfect world, every strategy in this book is integrated into every future project that we do,” Kruse said.
Nordmeyer compared this universal design awakening to the push for sustainable building design in the 1990s. Once you start crafting buildings to be LEED certified or universally accessible, there’s no going back to the old way, he said.
“The Harkin Institute process, and the fact that I've gotten more disabled during this process, has really made it more obvious that this is the way we have to design.”
Celebrate 30 years of the ADA
The Harkin Institute for Public Policy & Citizen Engagement will host a virtual rally at noon on July 26, 2020 on its Twitter and Instagram accounts to celebrate 30 years of the ADA.
Former U.S. senators and disability rights activists Tom Harkin and Bob Dole will be among the featured speakers.

Blurring the lines of media authenticity: Prigozhin-linked group funding Libyan broadcast media,cyber.fsi.stanford.edu,https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/io/news/libya-prigozhin,20-03-20 0:00,"The Stanford Internet Observatory has been investigating new facets to the manipulation of the local media environment in Libya: Russian actors who are known to have previously created and sponsored online news media fronts and associated Facebook pages, now appear to be expanding into similar activities in broadcast media. By surreptitiously financing a well-established well-known media brand, these actors are taking a Cold War-era strategy of supporting local media outlets and updating it for the digital age.
Over the past year Russia has become increasingly involved in the conflict in Libya. Some of this involvement is kinetic: Russian mercenary soldiers employed by firms linked to Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Russian businessman with close ties to Vladimir Putin, are fighting alongside Khalifa Haftar’s self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) forces. Modern Russian weapons have been found on battlefields. Alongside the kinetic, the relationship includes media and information operations support for political candidates, and social media influence operations: Stanford Internet Observatory research previously found that Prigozhin-linked firms had created Facebook Pages bolstering not only Haftar but Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, one of Muammar Gaddafi’s surviving sons. Prigozhin may be trying to bring Gaddafi supporters to Haftar’s camp, or simply playing multiple sides of the local power game by bolstering two likely presidential contenders. While the motivation remains a matter of state strategy, it is clear that Russian actors are exerting influence via traditional as well as social media channels.
This involvement takes the form of both direct involvement in content creation as well as financial support for local creators, which presents a challenge for evaluating authenticity in the Libyan media ecosystem: when does foreign support for local media cross the line into facilitating inauthentic behavior?
In November the Dossier Center, a London-based investigative organization, shared an appendix from an internal Prigozhin-linked group document with the Stanford Internet Observatory team. The leaked document, dated March 20, 2019, describes three media interventions in Libya:
entering into a financial arrangement in which a Prigozhin-linked firm would own 50% of the former state-run TV station under Muammar Gaddafi (now supportive of Saif al-Islam Gaddafi); creating a physical pro-LNA newspaper, Voice of the People consulting on Alhadath, a Haftar-aligned TV station.
In this post, we discuss the social media and online presence of these television channels and the Voice of the People print newspaper. Key findings include:
By secretly investing in a long-standing TV channel, Prigozhin is refining his ability to blur the lines of media authenticity.
The TV channel (and its related social media entities) have historically been pro-Gaddafi; in the months since investment, they additionally became supportive of Haftar. This backfired, with social media users mocking the obvious shift in tone and calling out what they perceived to be the channel’s foreign backers.
A real political party, the Civil Democratic Party, posts PDFs of the Prigozhin-funded newspaper on its Facebook Page, with the party’s logo on the paper’s header. The newspaper is vigorously anti-GNA and pro-Haftar.
Internal document from a Prigozhin-linked group. Source: The Dossier Center.
Aljamahiria TV station and Jana News Agency
The Aljamahiria TV channel was the former Libyan state-run broadcasting organization under Gaddafi. Anti-Gaddafi rebel forces removed it from the air in 2011. It appeared again in 2014, and is now on Nilesat, an Egyptian communications satellite.
The Dossier Center document describes “the company” (the name for the Prigozhin-linked group) providing technical, financial, and advisory support for a TV station, Aljamahiria TV since January 2019. The memo goes on to say that “the channel criticizes the activities of Khalifa Haftar [LNA], Khalid Al-Mishri [head of the Tripoli-based High Council of State] and Western countries” and supports Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, and notes that “50% of the channel (in a joint venture) belongs to the Russian side” (translated).
The memo highlights the transformative effects of the Prigozhin investment, saying that the TV channel used to be:
chaotic, regularly interrupted for 2-3 months. Currently, the channel broadcasts on a regular basis and is popular with supporters of Saif al-Islam Gaddafi. The channel’s monthly audience exceeds 6 million views in the Middle East and North Africa. Moreover, the company’s employees created a unified information service for the Jamahiria TV channel and the Jana news agency. In March 2019, the company’s specialists launched 6 new regular broadcasts and resumed work [...]
The memo then shows before and after images of the studio, illustrating that the Prigozhin investment helped modernize the studio.
Heading reads: ""On-air studio: Before and after working with the company""
Aljamahiria and Jana News Agency have an extensive presence on social media platforms, sometimes with substantial followings and frequent posting schedules:
Aljamahiriya TV station and Jana News Agency social media presence.
Content on social media accounts associated with this TV station indicate that it shares Muammar Gaddafi nostalgia content (ie, “Muammar Gaddafi, I wish that you would come back.”) and content supportive of Saif al-Islam Gaddafi. For several months the additional posts on Aljamahiria’s Facebook Page were typically neutral news statements -- noting that there were clashes south of Tripoli, or posts about the weather.
In December 2019, however, the tone changed. Posts began to appear that were critical of Turkish military support to the UN-recognized Tripoli-based Government of National Accord, and more supportive of the LNA. For example, a post on January 6, 2020 said قوات الشعب المسلح تحرر مدينة سرت (The forces of the armed population free the city of Sirte). The phrase “forces of the armed population” is a phrase originating from the Gaddafi regime to describe the official Libyan armed forces. Here the channel is using the term interchangeably to describe the LNA advancement on Sirte.
Posts on al-Jamahiriya became more anti-GNA over time. The anti-GNA slant measure comes from a dictionary of 37 words and phrases like “liberation” (as in “Haftar will liberate Tripoli”) and “Turkey” (as in “report reveals the number of Syrian mercenaries arriving from Turkey to Libya”) and “Qatar”/”terrorism”/”Muslim Brotherhood” (as in “Doha, funded by `Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood’ to spread terrorism in Libya”).
Beginning in December 2019, social media users noticed this trend; they called it “حفترة قناة الخضراء” (Hafterization of the Green Channel). On December 19 one Facebook user commented in a group that Aljamahiria had shifted from referring to “Haftar’s militias” to “the Armed Forces,” language that aligns Gaddafi-era terms with Haftar’s LNA. One Page mocked Aljamahiria’s dramatic shift in tone, suggesting satirically that even the word “prayers” needs to be renamed “Haftar’s prayers.” In one comment thread a user said “the channel is now with Haftar,” and another responded saying “no, Haftar is now with the channel.”
Authentic Gadaffi supporters took to Facebook to express their displeasure at how now Hafterized Aljamahiria was misrepresenting them. One commenter even wrote a few poetic verses to describe his anger:
Yes, he really hafterised it
from Ghat to Sebha ..
and He ruined it ..
The green channel, he hafterized it.
Yes, rats hafterize yourselves.
The zero hour always equals zero if it's according to the local time of the Karama leader's watch.
A user posted Aljamahiria content using laughing emojis after noting that Aljamahiria encouraged people to fight with Haftar.

Aljamahiria then backed off the pro-LNA language; in one post they called Haftar a war criminal. But social media users noticed this shift in tone as well. In February 2020 a pro-GNA Page posted an Aljamahiria video, saying that the channel was suddenly criticizing Haftar after having encouraging the youth to fight with him. In response to an Aljamahiria video that was critical of Haftar and posted in February 2020, one user wrote: “why did u turn on the army?” (translated). Two users posted 1,500 word tomes theorizing about the shifts in Aljamahiria’s tone, with one directing remarks toward what he perceived to be Aljamahiria’s foreign backers: he accused Jamahiriya of accepting money from foreign countries and said that Jamahiriya had become a channel of “propaganda and distorted ideas.” A Twitter user commented on the new tone shift as well.
Libya Facts, a pro-Gaddafi Page, defended the Aljamahiria Page, showing screenshots of anti-Haftar posts on Aljamahiria to allay suspicions. Libya Facts also noted that the channel is based out of Egypt and the Egyptian government carefully monitors who receives foreign funding, implying that Aljamahiria could not possibly be tied to any foreign entity.
Aljamahiria has a professional, polished Instagram account, created in October 2019, which shares original Muammar Gaddafi nostalgia memes and pro-Saif al Islam Gaddafi memes.

Lower right: A meme bolstering Saif al-Islam Gaddafi on the Aljamahiria Instagram account.
The Jana News Agency, which is explicitly part of the Aljamahiria network (its logo says Aljamahiria News Agency) and is mentioned in the leaked document, has a website, jana-ly.co, that was created in January 2017. Its original Facebook Page had 5 admins in Egypt, 1 admin in the UK, and 3 admins whose location are hidden. This pattern is similar to the administrator ownership pattern of Facebook Pages involved in Libyan influence operations that we identified in previous research, where Pages typically had 5 Egyptian Page admins and 1 other admin in a European country. Interestingly, jana-ly.co has an article from November 2, 2019, reposted from Russian state media outlet Sputnik, about the Prigozhin-linked Facebook takedown of influence operations targeting Libya. It claims that Facebook removed those Pages in anger over the success of the Russia-Africa Sochi summit. In February 2020 its Page came down, and days later it respawned as facebook.com/jana2.ly with 3 admins in Egypt.
We also found a Facebook Page called الجبهة الشعبية لتحرير ليبيا (Popular Front for the Liberation of Libya) that lists as its “media platforms” facebook.com/aljamahiriytv and facebook.com/janaly.co Like the TV channel and Jana News, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Libya Page has pro-Gaddafi content. It has also run anti-Sarraj and anti-Turkish ads. The Popular Front Page also lists facebook.com/safalbonyan, facebook.com/libya24tv, and facebook.com/libyamandela as additional “media platforms”, which similarly have pro-Gaddafi posts. All of these Pages have a majority of administrators in Egypt.
Consistent with the trends we observe on these social platforms, New York Time reporting suggests that Haftar is welcoming support from former Gaddafi supporters.
Voice of the People Newspaper
Another entity mentioned in the Dossier Center memo is the Voice of the People newspaper. The memo notes that “since January 2019, the Company’s specialists began publishing the Voice of the People newspaper. The newspaper is distributed in the territory controlled by the LNA. The general content of the newspaper is criticism of the new draft Constitution, the policies of Al-Misri and Sarraj, support for the activities of the LNA and the image of Khalifa Haftar. The circulation of the newspaper is 300,000 copies. At the moment, 2 circulations of the newspaper have been prepared and distributed.”
The creation of a print newspaper is noteworthy. New York Times reporting suggests Russian entities created a newspaper in Madagascar in 2018 as well, saying: “Russians published their own newspaper in the local language and hired students to write fawning articles about the president to help him win another term.”
We found the two issues of the newspaper here and here -- as of February 2020, there don’t appear to be more. The newspaper is vehemently against the new draft constitution, encouraging citizens to vote “no” on it. The Constitutional Drafting Assembly voted to allow military personnel to be eligible for president only if they renounce their military positions two years before elections, a policy that pro-Haftar groups were against given that he would likely run for the position in the future. The latest (fourth) draft of the constitution also says that presidential candidates must relinquish any foreign nationalities at least one year before elections; Haftar has American citizenship. The Civil Democratic Party appears to be close to Haftar, and supports his offensive on Tripoli. Accounts on Twitter have said that the newspaper is being distributed for free; one posted a photo of it.

The paper is branded with the logo of the Civil Democratic Party, and issues have been posted as PDFs on the Civil Democratic Party Facebook Page. The Party is made up of former members of Libya’s Transitional Council and former ambassadors. Its Facebook Page was created in September 2017, and has 3 admins in Libya. The CDP appears to have their own video recording capability, occasionally posting videos reminiscent of news broadcasts.
Cover page of the March 2019 issue of the Voice of the People newspaper.
The first issue of the newspaper, published in January 2019, included an article introducing the paper, written by the president of the party. The party leader expressed allegiances toward the LNA. The issue focused on criticizing the constitutional drafting project. Articles implied the new draft constitution was undemocratic and “succumbed to political Islam.” An opinion piece urged citizens to vote against the constitution.

The first issue of the newspaper told Libyans not to be fooled, and to vote “no” on the draft constitution.
The second issue of the newspaper, published in March 2019, led with an article called “The Hidden Lebanese Government” (translated). The article alleged that the Government of National Accord -- the internationally-recognized Tripoli-based government -- is letting international actors like the UN and Lebanon take over the government. Another article on the cover page noted that the average Libyan is suffering, with queues at banks and corruption. The GNA should be replaced, it claimed, and the state should regain its monopoly on force and bring back the rule of law. A cartoon on the cover page shows the GNA Prime Minister bringing foreign allies a pie of Libya. Each foreign actor vies for a piece of Libya, and the Special Representative for the UN in Libya says there will be enough for everyone.

Alhadath TV Station
The third aspect of this memo references the LNA-aligned TV channel: “In February 2019, the company’s specialists conducted an external audit of the activities of Alhadath TV channel (LNA channel), on the basis of which they prepared and presented their recommendations for the optimization of broadcasting to the [Haftar] team.”
The Facebook Page associated with this TV channel has about 875,000 followers. It was created in 2016, and has seven Page administrators in Libya. The Page is generally pro-Haftar and often reposts statements from Haftar’s spokesman, Ahmed al Mismari. There is a Twitter account, @libyaalhadathtv, created in 2015, which has 89,100 followers. The only account that the Twitter account follows is @news9ly, which was created in July 2019 and shared LibyaAlhadathTV content. There is also a YouTube channel, created in 2016, which notes that the station (like Aljamahiria) is on Nilesat. Its associated website is libyaalhadath.net. The current nature of Prigozhin’s involvement in this TV channel is unclear, though we note that Facebook lists the Alhadath Page as a “Related Page” to the new Jana News Agency Page.
Pages discussed in this post, with a vertical line noting the start of January 2019. The internal document suggests some Prigozhin activities in Libya began in January.
Our prior research showed that Russian actors created Facebook Pages supportive of Saif Gaddafi and Haftar. This leaked document suggests that Russian actors are supporting these two figures in Libya’s traditional print and television media space as well. In our earlier research, we found that Russian actors had franchised out management of their Facebook Pages to content creators in Egypt. This made it harder for Libyans to detect the involvement of Russian actors. Similarly, here we see foreign actors inserting themselves into the legitimate Libyan media environment by way of financial support. While Libyans noticed the change in tone on the Pages, attributing that involvement to specific actors is a significant challenge. Going forward, the combination of franchising and virtually-undetectable financial support will make gauging the independence and authenticity of media outlets online and offline even more difficult for disinformation researchers. These tactics will also create difficult decisions for platforms about whether the behavior violates their terms of service.",LIBYAN JAMAHIRYA BROADCASTING CORPORATION,20-03-20 0:00,de512e6109d0d9c0ce60c3d6a5113d1c5a225ef6095283db8ba59a2a1caf22c6,0.32704714,"[{'score': 0.435661256313324, 'topic': 'cyber'}, {'score': 0.40260979533195496, 'topic': 'bribery'}]","[{'sentiment': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.382954865694046, 'name': 'Yevgeny Prigozhin', 'topic': 'assets'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.507561445236206, 'name': 'Khalifa Haftar', 'topic': 'cyber'}]","The Stanford Internet Observatory has been investigating new facets to the manipulation of the local media environment in Libya: Russian actors who are known to have previously created and sponsored online news media fronts and associated Facebook pages, now appear to be expanding into similar activities in broadcast media. Over the past year Russia has become increasingly involved in the conflict in Libya. Prigozhin may be trying to bring Gaddafi supporters to Haftar’s camp, or simply playing multiple sides of the local power game by bolstering two likely presidential contenders. This involvement takes the form of both direct involvement in content creation as well as financial support for local creators, which presents a challenge for evaluating authenticity in the Libyan media ecosystem: when does foreign support for local media cross the line into facilitating inauthentic behavior? The leaked document, dated March 20, 2019, describes three media interventions in Libya:
entering into a financial arrangement in which a Prigozhin-linked firm would own 50% of the former state-run TV station under Muammar Gaddafi (now supportive of Saif al-Islam Gaddafi); creating a physical pro-LNA newspaper, Voice of the People consulting on Alhadath, a Haftar-aligned TV station. The TV channel (and its related social media entities) have historically been pro-Gaddafi; in the months since investment, they additionally became supportive of Haftar. The newspaper is vigorously anti-GNA and pro-Haftar. Internal document from a Prigozhin-linked group. The memo goes on to say that “the channel criticizes the activities of Khalifa Haftar [LNA], Khalid Al-Mishri [head of the Tripoli-based High Council of State] and Western countries” and supports Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, and notes that “50% of the channel (in a joint venture) belongs to the Russian side” (translated).

U.N. body adopts Japan-EU motion to document North Korea rights abuses for future prosecution,www.japantimes.co.jp,https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/03/25/asia-pacific/u-n-document-north-korean-crimes-prosecution-someday/,25-03-17 15:36,"The United Nations’ top human rights body agreed on Friday to widen its investigation into violations in North Korea with a view to documenting alleged crimes against humanity for future prosecution.
The body also expressed concern over the lack of progress in settling the issue of Japanese nationals abducted by North Korean agents in the 1970s and 1980s .
The 47-member U.N. Human Rights Council adopted a resolution submitted by Japan and the European Union and backed by the United States.
The resolution calls for North Korea to cooperate and allow access to U.N. investigators, which the reclusive state has never done.
International pressure is building on the country, ruled by Kim Jong Un, over its nuclear tests. Fox News reported on Thursday that North Korea was in the final stages of another test, possibly within days.
The United States has imposed fresh sanctions on foreign companies or individuals for violating export controls on North Korea, as well as Iran and Syria, the State Department said on Friday.
The U.N. human rights office in Seoul would be strengthened for two years with international criminal justice experts to establish a central repository for testimony and evidence “with a view to developing possible strategies to be used in any future accountability process.”
The Seoul office’s current six-strong staff records testimony from interviews with dozens of North Korean defectors each week, a U.N. official said.
“This not only brings North Koreans one step closer to justice for human rights crimes they have suffered, but should also make North Korean government officials think twice before inflicting more abuse,” John Fisher from Human Rights Watch said in a statement.
A U.N. commission of inquiry, in a landmark 2014 report based on interviews and hearings with defectors, catalogued massive violations — including large prison camps, starvation and executions — that it said should be brought to the International Criminal Court.
The resolution faced some opposition. Just prior to the adoption of the motion, a Chinese representative said Beijing does not want human rights to be addressed as a political issue, adding that provocative actions must be avoided as the situation on the Korean Peninsula is complex. A U.N. diplomatic source said Cuba and Venezuela were also opposed.
North Korea said it “categorically and totally” rejected the resolution. The text was “a product of the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK (the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) from A to Z,” its envoy said after boycotting the debate.
“The ‘resolution’ is nothing more than a document for interference in internal affairs of sovereign states and represents the culmination of politicization, selectivity and double standards of human rights,” Mun Jong Chol, a counselor at North Korea’s mission to the U.N. in Geneva, told reporters. It was a fraudulent document full of “lies, fabrications and plots.”
China said it “dissociated” itself from the council’s decision and called for dialogue. The situation on the divided Korean Peninsula is “complex and sensitive,” and all sides should avoid provocation that might lead to an escalation, diplomat Jiang Yingfeng said.
The world should “focus on the bigger picture,” he added.
On the issue of Japanese abductees, the resolution expresses “grave concern” at the lack of positive action by North Korea and calls for settling the matter as quickly as possible.
There has been no substantial progress in bilateral talks on the issue, although North Korea agreed with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government in 2014 to reinvestigate the abduction issue.
Pyongyang said in February last year it was suspending the probe in response to tougher sanctions imposed by Japan over North Korean nuclear and missile tests.
The resolution makes no mention of the recent assassination in Malaysia of Kim Jong Nam, the estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Malaysian authorities suspect North Korea orchestrated the assassination of Kim Jong Nam, who is known to have criticized the country’s hereditary succession custom, at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Feb. 13, using the deadly nerve agent VX. North Korea claims Kim died from a heart attack.

The Impact of Tariffs and Trade on the United States,taxfoundation.org,https://taxfoundation.org/impact-of-tariffs-free-trade/,27-06-18 12:13,"Key Findings
Trade barriers such as tariffs raise prices and reduce available quantities of goods and services for U.S. businesses and consumers, which results in lower income, reduced employment, and lower economic output.
Measures of trade flows, such as the trade balance, are accounting identities and should not be misunderstood to be indicators of economic health. Production and exchange – regardless of the balance on the current account – generate wealth.
Since the end of World War II, the world has largely moved away from protectionist trade policies toward a rules-based, open trading system. Post-war trade liberalization has led to widespread benefits, including higher income levels, lower prices, and greater consumer choice.
Openness to trade and investment has substantially contributed to U.S. growth, but the U.S. still maintains duties against several categories of goods. The highest tariffs are concentrated on agriculture, textiles, and footwear.
The Trump administration has enacted tariffs on imported solar panels, washing machines, steel, and aluminum, plans to impose tariffs on Chinese imports, and is investigating further tariffs on Chinese imports and automobile imports.
The effects of each tariff will be lower GDP, wages, and employment in the long run. The tariffs will also make the U.S. tax code less progressive because the increased tax burden would fall hardest on lower- and middle-income households.
Rather than erect barriers to trade that will have negative economic consequences, policymakers should promote free trade and the economic benefits it brings.
Introduction
Trade barriers, such as tariffs, have been demonstrated to cause more economic harm than benefit; they raise prices and reduce availability of goods and services, thus resulting, on net, in lower income, reduced employment, and lower economic output.
Since the end of World War II, the world has largely moved away from protectionist trade policies toward a rules-based, open trading system. This widespread reduction in trade barriers has contributed to economic prosperity in many ways, including large increases in trade activity and accompanying gains in economic output and income.
Openness to trade and investment has substantially contributed to U.S. growth, but the U.S. still maintains duties against several categories of goods. The overall effective rate of these tariffs appears low, but varies widely across categories of goods. Some of the highest duties apply to clothing, apparel, and footwear; some of the lowest apply to aircrafts, spacecrafts, and live animals.
This paper provides a brief overview of tariffs, the basic economics of trade and barriers to trade, and explains why the trade balance shouldn’t be viewed as an indicator of economic health. Then the paper reviews the current United States Harmonized Tariff Schedule and recent developments in United States tariff policies.
Overview of Tariffs
Tariffs are a type of excise tax that is levied on goods produced abroad at the time of import. They are intended to increase consumption of goods manufactured at home by increasing the price of foreign-produced goods. [1]
Generally, tariffs result in consumers paying more for goods than they would have otherwise in order to prop up industries at home. Though tariffs may afford some short-term protection for domestic industries that produce the goods subject to tariffs by shielding competition, they do so at the expense of others in the economy, including consumers and other industries.[2]
As consumers spend more on goods on which the duty is imposed, they have less to spend on other goods—so, one industry is propped up to the disadvantage of all others. This results in a less efficient allocation of resources, which can then result in slower economic growth. Tariffs also tend to be regressive in nature, burdening lower-income consumers the most.
Trade and the economy
Trade makes a nation wealthy, and conversely, trade restrictions make a nation poorer.[3]
Trade enables nations to specialize in activities in which they have a comparative advantage; in other words, what they can produce at a relatively lower opportunity cost, and trade for what they would otherwise have to produce at a higher opportunity cost.[4] This means nations produce more goods and services for less and exchange those for goods and services from other countries, resulting in higher levels of consumption than would be possible without trade.
Through this process, productivity increases as resources flow to the economic activities in which a country has a comparative advantage.[5] This leads to employment gains where production is most efficient, though it can also lead to employment losses in sectors where production is comparatively less efficient—an outcome of which policymakers should remain cognizant. On net, though, trade results in higher levels of productivity, income, and output throughout the economy. And over time, increased trade has made the United States more productive and has contributed to large increases in Americans’ standard of living.[6]
Stay Informed on Tax Policy Research and Analysis
Since the end of World War II, growth in annual real global trade has outpaced GDP growth, growing on average 1.5 times faster.[7] Much of this increase in trade can be explained by reductions in barriers to international exchange, such as tariffs and quotas.[8] Post-war trade liberalization has led to widespread benefits, including higher income levels, lower prices, and greater consumer choice.[9]
Estimates of these post-war gains from freer trade range up to $10,000 per household in the United States.[10] The positive, long-term economic effects of trade – increased competition, innovation, productivity, employment, wages, and output – provide benefits that outweigh the short-term transition costs trade can cause.
But what about trade balances?
Trade clearly results in positive economic outcomes, allowing people in different countries to specialize in what they do best, and then exchange physical goods, services, and financial assets across borders. But there are often misperceptions about the measurements that economists and policymakers use to track flows of trade.
The balance-of-payments system consists of the current account, which measures the flow of goods and services, and the capital account, which records the flow of finances.[11] Walking through an example of a business that imports and exports is useful to understand how the balance-of-payments system works.[12]
Suppose an American business loads $100 million worth of goods it produced onto a cargo ship. When the ship leaves the country, it is credited to the current account as an export of $100 million. Now suppose that the business sells the goods to France; after shipping and other costs, the business makes a 20 percent profit selling to French customers.
The business now has $120 million it can use to make purchases in France. Suppose they decide to purchase wine, load it back on the now-empty cargo ship, and return to the United States; the value of the imported wine ($120 million) is debited from the current account. The business now sells the wine to its American customers, making another $10 million in profit. The business has made $20 million from the original sell of the goods in the cargo ship, and another $10 million from selling the imported wine, for a net profit of $30 million.
According to the current accounts, America has exported $100 million to France and imported $120 million from France—resulting in a so-called trade deficit of $20 million. But, we can see that the American business is clearly better off by having made these exchanges, $30 million better off.
Suppose in the next month, the American business sends another cargo ship to France with another $100 million worth of goods. But unfortunately, the entire ship sinks before it reaches France, leaving the business at a total loss. The $100 million export was credited to the current account; because there is no corresponding import, the national accounts show a trade surplus of $100 million. We can agree that no one has been made better off here, even though the accounting identity shows a trade surplus.
The capital account is also involved in these transactions, recording the exchange of financial assets, like currency. When the U.S. business buys wine from France, they give U.S. dollars in exchange for that wine—this is credited to the capital account. Conversely, when the U.S. business sold goods to France in exchange for Euros, this was debited to the capital account. Thus, in the example above, the capital account had a $20 million surplus. This indicates that foreigners have U.S. dollars that, at some point in the future, will be reinvested into the United States. In other words, when we spend dollars on foreign goods, those dollars do not disappear; they will return to the U.S. as a capital inflow at some time in the future.
The balance-of-payments system is simply an accounting identity; the current and capital accounts track flows of goods, services, and financial assets between people, and they move in the opposite direction of one another. A current account (trade) deficit is simply another way of stating that we have a capital account surplus; neither has a causal implication for the health of the economy. Whether a business sells to or buys from domestic or foreign consumers, they do so because the trade is profitable. Production and exchange – regardless of the balance on the current account – generate wealth.
Barriers to trade reduce economic output and incomes
When countries erect barriers to trade, such as tariffs, they raise prices and divert resources away from relatively efficient economic activities towards less efficient economic activities.[13] It is worth noting that in addition to tariffs, many other policy measures can create barriers to trade that have effects like tariffs.[14] As a result of such measures, consumers pay more for goods than they otherwise would have, businesses face higher costs than they otherwise would have, and on net, output and employment fall.
Tariffs in particular can have this effect through a few channels. One possibility is that a tariff may be passed on to producers and consumers in the form of higher prices. Tariffs can raise the cost of intermediate goods such as parts and materials, which then raises the price of goods that use those inputs and reduces private sector output.[15], [16] This would result in lower incomes for both workers and the owners of capital. Similarly, higher consumer prices due to tariffs would reduce the after-tax value of both labor and capital income. Because these higher prices would reduce the return to labor and capital, they would incentivize Americans to work and invest less, leading to lower output.[17]
Alternatively, the U.S. dollar may appreciate in response to tariffs, offsetting the potential price increase on U.S. consumers.[18] However, the more valuable dollar would make it more difficult for exporters to sell their goods on the global market, resulting in lower revenues for exporters. This would also result in lower U.S. output and incomes for both workers and owners of capital, reducing incentives for work and investment, and leading to a smaller economy.
Academic studies have quantified the costs of tariffs and shown that tariffs often fail to achieve their objectives.[19] A comprehensive study of tariffs in place in 1990 found that the annual consumer costs per American job “saved” range from $100,000 to over $1 million, with an average of $170,000.[20] More recently, a study analyzing the 2002 steel tariffs imposed by the George W. Bush administration found that the first year the tariffs were in effect, more American workers lost their jobs due to higher steel prices (200,000) than the total number employed by the steel industry itself at the time (187,500).[21]
These results aren’t unique to the 2002 steel tariffs. A Congressional Budget Office report from 1986 reviewed the effects of protectionist policies covering textiles and apparel, steel, footwear, and automobiles. The policies did effectively increase costs, which resulted in slightly higher profits for the firms. However, the report finds, “In none of the cases studied was protection sufficient to revitalize the affected industry.”[22]
The outcomes of past protectionist policies indicate that protectionism simply does not work. Any potential short-term benefits of using protectionist policies to shield domestic industries from foreign competition come at the expense of others in the economy; the consequences are higher prices, less efficient resource allocation, and job losses throughout other sectors, and in the long run, failure to help the intended beneficiaries.
The United States Maintains a Wide Variety of Tariffs
While global trade restrictions have dramatically fallen over the past several decades, the United States still maintains many tariffs on a wide variety of goods. The United States International Trade Commission (USITC) publishes the Harmonized Tariff Schedule, which contains 99 chapters describing various tariffs that apply to different categories of goods.[23] The USITC also maintains a tariff database, reporting statistics that include the value of imports appraised by the U.S. Customs Service as well as estimates of the calculated duties by commodity.
A superficial glance at the database might convey the idea that tariffs are relatively small. For example, in 2017, the total value of imports was $2.3 trillion and the total estimated duties were $33.1 billion, implying an overall average tariff of about 1.42 percent.[24] Though the average U.S. tariff looks small, some individual categories of goods are subject to much higher import barriers.
In 2017, for example, the United States imported $109.5 billion worth of textiles and textile articles, and paid $12.6 billion in tariffs on these imports, or an average applied tariff of 11.5 percent.[25] Within this category of imported goods, some subcategories faced even higher tax burdens. The rate on knitted or crocheted apparel and clothing accessories was above 14 percent in 2017.[26]
Browsing the Harmonized Tariff Schedule shows that in some cases, even higher rates may apply. The maximum rate of duty that applies to “Men’s or boy’s overcoats, carcoats, capes, cloaks, anoraks (including ski jackets), windbreakers and similar articles, knitted or crocheted – Other” is 72 percent.[27] The most recent World Trade Organization Policy Review of the United States found that:[28]
Tariffs above 25% ad valorem are concentrated in agriculture (notably dairy, tobacco, and vegetable products), footwear, and textiles. An estimated 22 tariff lines corresponding to agricultural products carry import duty rates above 100%.
Source: United States International Trade Commission, “Interactive Tariff and Trade DataWeb,” https://dataweb.usitc.gov/ Table 1:Higher Average Rates Apply to Certain Sections of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule, Billions of Dollars Section Customs Value Calculated Duty Average Applied Rate XI: Textiles and Textile Articles $109.5 $12.6 11.53% VIII: Raw Hides and Skins, Leather, Furskins and Articles Thereof; Saddlery and Harness; Travel Goods, Handbags and Similar Containers; Articles of Animal Gut (Other Than Silkworm Gut) 13.8 1.4 10.20% XII: Footwear, Headgear, Umbrellas, Sun Umbrellas, Walking Sticks, Seatsticks, Whips, Riding-Crops and Parts Thereof; Prepared Feathers and Articles Made Therewith; Artificial Flowers; Articles of Human Hair 30.7 3.1 10.09% All Sections 2,313.0 33.1 1.42%
In addition to causing economic harm for the reasons discussed above, tariffs generally have nonneutral impacts across different goods and different sectors, and this nonneutrality can further reduce welfare. Uneven tax burdens may distort investment decisions, adding complexity that penalizes certain goods worse than others and thus negatively impacting economic growth. Though tariffs generated a relatively small amount of revenue in 2017, $33.1 billion, high rates concentrated on certain categories of imports creates distortions in the economy.
Tariffs and the Trump Administration
Within the first few months of 2018, the Trump administration enacted tariffs on imported solar panels, washing machines, steel, and aluminum.[29] The administration plans to soon impose a 25 percent tariff on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports.[30] In addition to these planned tariffs, pending investigations regarding further tariffs on up to $100 billion more worth of Chinese imports as well as automobile imports mean more tariffs could be imposed going forward.[31]
The rationale for these various tariffs range from national security to misconceptions about trade balances to alleged intellectual property theft by China. Though there is wide agreement that certain trading practices are unfair and call for a response, levying broad tariffs is not likely the approach that will result in the desired policy changes.[32] The effects of each tariff will be lower GDP, wages, and employment in the long run.[33]
For example, according to the Tax Foundation’s Taxes and Growth model, President Trump’s proposal to raise taxes by approximately $37.5 billion annually (by levying a 25 percent tariff on $150 billion worth of Chinese imports) would reduce the long-run level of GDP by 0.1 percent, or about $20 billion.[34] The smaller economy would result in 0.1 percent lower wages and 79,000 fewer full-time equivalent jobs. The tariffs will also make the U.S. tax code less progressive because the increased tax burden would fall hardest on lower- and middle-income households.[35]
Source: Tax Foundation Taxes and Growth Model, March 2018 Table 2. Economic Impact of Tariffs on $150 Billion in Chinese Imports Change in long-run GDP -0.1% Change in long-run GDP (Billions $2018) -$20.6 Change in long-run wage rate -0.1% Change in full-time equivalent jobs -79,000
These estimates do not account for the uneven impact these taxes would have across sectors, nor the costs of retaliatory actions that have already been imposed and may be proposed in the future. These effects would both result in worse economic outcomes.
Stay Informed on Tax Policy Research and Analysis
Conclusion
Since the end of World War II, public policy has shifted to embrace free and open trade, and reduced many trade barriers. This increase in international trading activity has led to increases in productivity, employment, output, and incomes for the countries involved.
Though historically the United States has led the movement toward free and open trade, the U.S. maintains high tariffs on select categories of goods. These sectors of the economy are not open to free trade or the competitive pressures free trade entails, and the related prices are artificially raised because of tariffs and other restrictions. Rather than focus trade policy on reducing these barriers, recent actions by the Trump administration have been to levy new tariffs and threaten further trade restrictions.
History has shown that tariffs fail to achieve their intended objectives, and result in higher prices, lower employment, and slower economic growth in the long run. Rather than erect barriers to trade that will have negative economic consequences, policymakers should promote free trade and the economic benefits it brings.

Trade barriers such as tariffs raise prices and reduce available quantities of goods and services for U.S. businesses and consumers, which results in lower income, reduced employment, and lower economic output. Measures of trade flows, such as the trade balance, are accounting identities and should not be misunderstood to be indicators of economic health. Production and exchange – regardless of the balance on the current account – generate wealth. Since the end of World War II, the world has largely moved away from protectionist trade policies toward a rules-based, open trading system. Rather than erect barriers to trade that will have negative economic consequences, policymakers should promote free trade and the economic benefits it brings. Introduction
Trade barriers, such as tariffs, have been demonstrated to cause more economic harm than benefit; they raise prices and reduce availability of goods and services, thus resulting, on net, in lower income, reduced employment, and lower economic output. Then the paper reviews the current United States Harmonized Tariff Schedule and recent developments in United States tariff policies. They are intended to increase consumption of goods manufactured at home by increasing the price of foreign-produced goods. [ 1]
Generally, tariffs result in consumers paying more for goods than they would have otherwise in order to prop up industries at home. Tariffs also tend to be regressive in nature, burdening lower-income consumers the most. The business now has $120 million it can use to make purchases in France. Suppose in the next month, the American business sends another cargo ship to France with another $100 million worth of goods. This indicates that foreigners have U.S. dollars that, at some point in the future, will be reinvested into the United States. In other words, when we spend dollars on foreign goods, those dollars do not disappear; they will return to the U.S. as a capital inflow at some time in the future. Tariffs in particular can have this effect through a few channels. Any potential short-term benefits of using protectionist policies to shield domestic industries from foreign competition come at the expense of others in the economy; the consequences are higher prices, less efficient resource allocation, and job losses throughout other sectors, and in the long run, failure to help the intended beneficiaries.

An American detained in North Korea said he had spied against the country and has asked for forgiveness, nine days after a US tourist was sentenced to 15 years in prison with hard labor for subversion.
Kim Tong Chol told a press conference in Pyongyang that he had collaborated with and spied for South Korean intelligence authorities in a plot to bring down the North’s leadership and tried to spread religious ideas among North Koreans.
North Korea sentences US college student to 15 years' hard labour Read more
In the past, the North Korean regime has used detainees as leverage to secure visits by high-profile US politicians, including former presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter. Detainees are often made to participate in stage-managed confessions.
Describing his acts as “shameful and ineffaceable”, Kim said he feels sorry for his crime and appealed to North Korean authorities to show him mercy by forgiving him.
He was born in South Korea and became a naturalized US citizen. In an interview with CNN in January, Kim said he lived in Fairfax, Virginia, before moving in 2011 to Yangji, a city near the Chinese-North Korean border. He said he commuted daily to Rason, a special economic zone in North Korea, where he was president of a trade and hotel services company.
He said in the Pyongyang press conference that he was detained in Rason last October.
North Korean authorities often arrange press conferences for US and other foreign detainees in which they read statements to acknowledge their wrongdoing and praise the North’s political system. Those detainees have said after their releases that they were coached or coerced on what to say.
South Korea’s national intelligence service, the country’s main spy agency, said Kim’s case was not related to the organization in any way and offered no further comment.
On 16 March, North Korea’s highest court sentenced Otto Warmbier, a 21-year-old University of Virginia undergraduate, to prison after he confessed he tried to steal a propaganda banner as a trophy for an acquaintance who wanted to hang it in her church. He tearfully confessed at his press conference to the attempted theft, which would be grounds in North Korea for a subversion charge.
The US government condemned the sentence and accused North Korea of using such American detainees as political pawns.
The North’s actions on the two American detainees came as it faces mounting pressure from the United States, South Korea and their allies following its nuclear weapons test and long-range rocket launch earlier this year. In recent days, North Korea has conducted weapons launches and issued warlike rhetoric in response to South Korean and US military drills that it sees as an invasion rehearsal.
North Korea in the past released some US detainees after high-profile American figures visited the country.
North Korea is currently holding three South Koreans and a Canadian pastor for what it calls espionage and attempts to establish churches and use religion to destroy the North’s system.

Rostam Qasemi, a senior IRGC-QF official who previously served as Iran’s oil minister, oversees the network, managing a group of individuals, shipping and oil companies, and vessels, to sell Iranian crude, condensates and gas oil, according to the Treasury.
The Mehdi Group managed vessels and found additional ones to move Iranian oil, the Treasury said when sanctioning the network. It has managed and provided the crew for at least seven of the vessels used by the network, the Treasury said. Mehdi Group branch offices in Singapore and the United Arab Emirates provide support services, billing and payments management, respectively, while a subsidiary in the UAE provides expertise in oil-related logistics.
Company officials, including Mehdi, have spread responsibility for vessel management across at least 10 subsidiaries and shell companies, the Treasury said. Other Mehdi Group officials work to ensure the vessels remain available for the network’s use, according to the Treasury. Anuj Bhardwaj arranges vessel inspections and registrations and Zafar Anis Ishteyaq Hussain tracks and processes millions of dollars in expenses the vessels incur, the Treasury said.

Central Bank of Syria,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bank_of_Syria#History,15-02-07 1:34,"The Central Bank of Syria (CBS) (Arabic: مصرف سورية المركزي‎, Masrif Suriat Almarkazi) is the central bank of Syria. The bank was established in 1953 and started operations in 1956. Its headquarters are in Damascus, with 11 branches in the provincial capitals.[2] The objective of the bank is ""to foster the stability, integrity and efficiency of the nation’s financial and payment systems so as to promote optimal macro economic performance"".[3]
The CBS issues Syria's currency, the Syrian pound and sets the intervention price in the foreign currency market for the Syrian pound on a daily basis. The CBS exercises control over all banks operating in Syria.
History [ edit ]
The primary legislation establishing a central bank and control of the banking system was passed in 1953, but the Central Bank did not commence operations until 1956. Its functions included issuing notes, controlling the money supply, acting as fiscal agent for the government, and controlling credit and commercial banks.[4]
After the 1956 Suez War, French and British banking interests were sequestered as enemy assets. In 1958, and after the union with Egypt, the state began to Arabize the commercial banking system and in 1961 implemented a policy of limited nationalization.[4]
In 1966, the state achieved complete ownership of commercial banking by merging all existing commercial banks into a single consolidated Commercial Bank of Syria. The government also created specialized banks to promote economic development.[4]
International sanctions [ edit ]
The US, Canada, EU, Arab League and Turkey have all imposed sanctions on the Central Bank because of the Syrian Civil War.[5][6][7] In the case of the US, sanctions had already been in place against the Central Bank since May 2004 under Section 311 of the Patriot Act, with the Bank being accused of money laundering.[8] The sanctions have shut Syria out of the global financial system. To circumvent the sanctions, Syrians effect foreign transactions through banks in neighbouring countries, especially Lebanon,[9] but making them vulnerable to economic disruptions in those countries.
The Central Bank has actively been trying to undermine these various sanctions, with bank officials meeting friendly institutions such as Gazprombank executives in Moscow in March 2012.[10] The Bank has taken an increasingly clandestine role in the domestic private sector as the country's failing economy has deterred foreign investment.[11]
Gold reserves [ edit ]
In April 2012, Reuters reported that since the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War in 2011, Syria's gold reserves have been cut in half from the pre-civil war level of about $17 billion, with the Syrian government using the reserves to cope with international sanctions.[12] The Governor of the Central Bank Adib Mayalah has sought to deny these reports.[13] This is similar to how the Syrian government is using its foreign reserves to meet the demands of a budget deficit which has greatly increased to about US$6.7 billion.[14]
Attacks on bank [ edit ]
Since the start of the Syrian Civil War, the Central Bank building was attacked three times: in April 2012 a rocket-propelled grenade was fired at the building; in April 2013 it was affected by a car bombing nearby; and in October 2013 it was hit by mortar shells.[15]

"Judgment of Trial Chamber II in the Kunarac, Kovac and Vukovic Case",www.asil.org,https://www.asil.org/insights/volume/6/issue/6/judgment-trial-chamber-ii-kunarac-kovac-and-vukovic-case,12-03-01 0:00,"In a landmark decision which develops international humanitarian law pertaining to sexual violence and enslavement, Trial Chamber II of the International Criminal Court for Yugoslavia (ICTY) on February 22, 2001, sentenced three ethnic Serbs to prison for their abuse of women at a ""rape camp"" near Foca, a small Bosnian town southeast of Sarajevo.[1] Dragoljub Kunarac was sentenced to 28 years, Radomir Kovac 20 years, and Zoran Vukovic 12 years.
The defendants were charged with torture, as a crime against humanity, under Article 5(f) of the Statute of the Tribunal, and as a violation of the laws or customs of war, under Article 3 of the Statute and recognized by Common Article 3(1)(a) of the 1949 Geneva Conventions. They were also charged with rape, as a crime against humanity, under Article 5(g) of the Statute and as a violation of the laws or customs of war, under Article 3 of the Statute. Finally, two of the defendants (Kunarac and Kovac) were charged with enslavement as a crime against humanity, under Article 5(c) of the Statute. These charges were brought pursuant to both Article 7(1) of the Statute (individual criminal responsibility ) and, with respect to Mr. Kunarac, Article 7(3) of the Statute (command responsibility).
The eight month long trial included testimony of sixty-three witnesses, including sixteen victims of rape held for months in sexual slavery and subjected to multiple gang rapes by the defendants and others. Elaborate measures were taken to protect the identity of the victims. Although they directly faced their accusers, the victims were identified by numbers, spoke through voice scramblers and were hidden from public view to protect their privacy.
The town of Foca was overrun by Serb forces in April 1992. The women and children from the Foca region were taken to collection points, such as Buk Bijela, a settlement south of Foca. From there, they were transferred by bus to Foca High School, where they were detained. Some of them were later taken to other places in and around Foca, such as private houses and apartments and the Partizan Sports Hall.
The conditions in these detention centers were deplorable. There were no hygiene facilities and the provision of food was inadequate and sporadic. Women and girls were threatened with guns and knives, raped within the centers and taken out to be raped. Some women who testified before the Tribunal had been taken out so often, by so many soldiers, that they were consequently unable to assess with precision the number of times they had been raped.. The evidence revealed that this occurred with the knowledge of the local authorities. The local police officers ""helped guard the women, and even joined in their mistreatment when approached [by the victims] for help against their oppressors.""
The testimony indicated that Serb forces raped dozens of Muslim women and girls, some as young as 12 years old. The defendants were identified by victims as being among those who would come to these detention centers at night to rape the women, or take them away to work in ""quasi brothels"" used by soldiers. Some women were ""rented,"" others were sold. One 12 year old who was sold by one of the accused has not been heard of since.
Kunarac commanded a reconnaissance unit of the Bosnian Serb army and Kovac and Vukovic were paramilitary leaders. The defendants acknowledged that they had taken part in the Serb military campaign in Foca, but denied the charges of torture, rape and enslavement.
In holding that the evidence supported the charges of rape and enslavement, the presiding judge, Judge Florence Mumba, emphasized the grave nature of the offenses. ""What the evidence shows,"" she said in a statement read in open court, ""are Muslim women and girls, mothers and daughters together, robbed of their last vestiges of human dignity. Women and girls, treated like chattels, pieces of property at the arbitrary disposal of the Serb occupation forces, and more specifically at the beck and call of the three accused.""
The Tribunal found that the actions of the three accused ""were part of a systematic attack against Muslim civilians."" The Tribunal reasoned:
They knew that one of the main purposes of that campaign was to drive the Muslims out of the region. They knew that one way to achieve this was to terrorize the Muslim civilian population in a manner that would make it impossible for them ever to return. They also knew of the general pattern of crimes, especially of detaining women and girls in different locations where they would be raped. The actions of all three accused...show beyond any doubt their knowledge of the detention centres, and of the practice of systematically transferring the women and girls to locations where they would be abused by Serb men.
The Tribunal flatly rejected the soldiers' claim that they were only following orders. Judge Mumba explained, ""The three accused were not just following orders, if there were such orders to rape Muslim women. The evidence shows free will on their part.""
One key issue with respect to the charges brought against Kunarac was command responsibility. The Tribunal understood the law of command responsibility as follows:
""A superior-subordinate relationship must exist for the recognition of this kind of responsibility. However, such a relationship cannot be determined by reference to formal status alone. Accordingly, formal designation as a commander is not necessary for establishing command responsibility, as such responsibility may be recognized by virtue of a person's de facto, as well as de jure, position as a commander. What must be established is that the superior had effective control over subordinates . That means that he must have had the material ability to exercise his powers to prevent and punish the commission of the subordinates' offenses."" [Decision at para. 396]
The Tribunal noted that ""the temporary nature of a military unit is not, in itself, sufficient to exclude a relationship of subordination between the members of a unit and its commander. [Para. 399] Nonetheless, the Tribunal found that the ""prosecutor failed to show that the soldiers who committed the offenses charged in the indictment were under the effective control of Kunarac at the time they committed the offenses"" and thus Kunarac could be held responsible only for the crimes he had committed.
This case represents a significant advance in the international law pertaining to the treatment of sexual violence in wartime. First, the decision demonstrates that rape will not be accepted as an intrinsic part of war. Rather, it is a crime against humanity and may constitute torture. The Tribunal sent a message that it would prosecute cases of sexual violence vigorously. That the accused were low-level soldiers was of no consequence. Judge Mumba made clear that ""lawless opportunists should expect no mercy, no matter how low their position in the chain of command may be.""
Second, although this Tribunal, as well as the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), has dealt with rape in the past, this was the first to focus entirely on wartime crimes of sexual violence. It was also the first decision by the ICTY to issue convictions for rape as a crime against humanity. The detailed discussion of the elements of rape in the decision, including a broad survey of domestic legal systems, will serve as an important guide in future cases [see paras. 436-464].
Third, while other international tribunals have considered the crime of torture, the Tribunal's authoritative discussion of the law of torture and its application to sexual violence cases is groundbreaking. After a review of relevant authorities, the Trial Chamber concluded that the definition of torture under international humanitarian law does not comprise the same elements as the definition of torture generally applied under human rights law. In particular, the Trial Chamber was ""of the view that the presence of a state official or of any other authority-wielding person in the torture process is not necessary for the offense to be regarded as torture under international humanitarian law."" [Para. 496]. The Trial Chamber held that, ""in the field of international humanitarian law, the elements of the offense of torture, under customary international law are as follows:
(i) The infliction, by act or omission, of severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental.
(ii) The act or omission must be intentional.
(iii) The act or omission must aim at obtaining information or a confession, or at punishing, intimidating or coercing the victim or a third person, or at discriminating, on any ground, against the victim or a third person. "" [Para. 497]
Fourth, the decision recognized the instrumental nature of rape in wartime. Judge Mumba rejected the phraseology ""systematic rape employed as a weapon of war,"" because ""this could be understood to mean a kind of concerted approach or an order given to the Bosnian Serb armed forces to rape Muslim women as part of their combat activities in the wider meaning."" The Tribunal found that there was insufficient evidence for such a finding. Instead, in the case at hand rape was ""used by members of the Bosnian Serb armed forces as an instrument of terror, an instrument they were given free rein to apply whenever and against whomever they wished."" This understanding of rape as an instrument of terror can be applied in other cases where the evidence does not prove the existence of a direct order to rape.
Finally, this decision was the first by an international tribunal to result in convictions for enslavement as a crime against humanity. The war crime tribunals after World War II considered slavery as an economic crime, not as a crime against humanity, nor did those tribunals regard sexual violence as a form of enslavement. The Tribunal defined enslavement broadly as ""a crime against humanity in customary international law consist[ing] of the exercise of any or all of the powers attaching to the right of ownership over a person."" [Para. 539] Factors to be taken into consideration in determining whether enslavement was committed included ""control of someone's movement, control of physical environment, psychological control, measures taken to prevent or deter escape, force, threat of force or coercion, duration, assertion of exclusivity , subjection to cruel treatment and abuse, control of sexuality and forced labour."" [Para. 543] Although two of the women who testified were sold as chattels by Radomir Kovac for 500 Deutsch Marks each, the Tribunal found that enslavement of the women did not necessarily require the buying or selling of a human being. This broader definition of slavery can be applied in sexual slavery cases in the future.
This case notwithstanding, the ICTY and ICTR have had a spotty record on sexual violence allegations. The ICTR has yet to act regarding sexual violence and the prosecutor for the ICTY has yet to issue indictments with respect to sexual violence committed in Kosovo. This decision may provide the impetus for future international criminal investigations and prosecutions for sexual violence and sexual slavery.

The town of Foca was overrun by Serb forces in April 1992. Some of them were later taken to other places in and around Foca, such as private houses and apartments and the Partizan Sports Hall. Women and girls were threatened with guns and knives, raped within the centers and taken out to be raped. Some women were ""rented,"" others were sold. Kunarac commanded a reconnaissance unit of the Bosnian Serb army and Kovac and Vukovic were paramilitary leaders. The Tribunal flatly rejected the soldiers' claim that they were only following orders. This case represents a significant advance in the international law pertaining to the treatment of sexual violence in wartime. First, the decision demonstrates that rape will not be accepted as an intrinsic part of war. That the accused were low-level soldiers was of no consequence. 436-464].
Third, while other international tribunals have considered the crime of torture, the Tribunal's authoritative discussion of the law of torture and its application to sexual violence cases is groundbreaking. In particular, the Trial Chamber was ""of the view that the presence of a state official or of any other authority-wielding person in the torture process is not necessary for the offense to be regarded as torture under international humanitarian law."" [ (ii) The act or omission must be intentional. Finally, this decision was the first by an international tribunal to result in convictions for enslavement as a crime against humanity. 543] Although two of the women who testified were sold as chattels by Radomir Kovac for 500 Deutsch Marks each, the Tribunal found that enslavement of the women did not necessarily require the buying or selling of a human being. The ICTR has yet to act regarding sexual violence and the prosecutor for the ICTY has yet to issue indictments with respect to sexual violence committed in Kosovo.","[{'name': 'Zoran Vukovic'}, {'name': 'Julie Mertus'}, {'name': 'Buk Bijela'}, {'name': 'Dragoljub Kunarac'}, {'name': 'Radomir Kovac'}, {'name': 'Foca'}, {'name': 'Florence Mumba'}, {'name': 'beck'}, {'org_name': 'the Partizan Sports Hall'}, {'org_name': 'ICTY'}, {'org_name': 'School of International Service'}, {'org_name': 'the Bosnian Serb army'}, {'org_name': 'Deutsch Marks'}, {'org_name': 'Foca High School'}, {'org_name': 'the International Criminal Tribunal'}, {'org_name': 'the International Criminal Court'}, {'org_name': 'para'}, {'org_name': 'Para'}, {'org_name': 'ICTR'}, {'org_name': 'the Trial Chamber'}, {'org_name': 'The Trial Chamber'}, {'org_name': 'U.S. Institute of Peace'}, {'org_name': 'Vukovic'}, {'org_name': 'the American University'}]",
Jamaica Gleaner - Bahamian who lived here on US 'Drug Kingpin' list - Monday,old.jamaica-gleaner.com,http://old.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20020610/lead/lead4.html,10-06-02 0:00,"Bahamian who lived here on US 'Drug Kingpin' list By Lloyd Williams, Senior Associate Editor THE BUSH Administration in the United States on June 4 released the names of seven alleged drug traffickers, including Samuels ""Ninety"" Knowles of the Bahamas, who the President has designated as appropriate for sanctions under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (21 U.S.C. 1901-1908). Knowles was first indicted on May 25, 2000 by a US federal grand jury in the Southern District of Florida, for smuggling cocaine. The grand jury returned a separate indictment on December 8, 2000 on charges of conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute it and marijuana, conspiracy to import cocaine and marijuana, possession with the intent to distribute cocaine and marijuana, and importation of cocaine and marijuana. Knowles was identified by the International Narcotics Control Strategy Report March 2001, as a major Bahamian drug trafficker who was extradited from Jamaica to the Bahamas in 2001. He is said to be the leader of a drug syndicate called ""Lexus Crew"", based in Nassau, Bahamas, and head of the ""Red Lane Crew"" which operated from Jamaica and the Bahamas to the United States and Canada. He is in custody in the Bahamas and is awaiting extradition to the United States. In March, law enforcement authorities in the Southern District of Florida laid charges against Knowles and nine other individuals said to be involved in a cocaine and marijuana trafficking organisation operating in the Southern District of Florida, the Bahamas, Jamaica and Canada. The charges include conspiracy to import cocaine and marijuana, conspiracy to possess cocaine and marijuana, with the intent to distribute the drugs, distribution of cocaine and marijuana, and importation of cocaine and marijuana into the United States. The US authorities said then that the multinational co-operative investigation had resulted in the seizure of more than 1,363 kilos of cocaine and, 399 kilos of marijuana and US$2.5 million. One of Knowles's associates is said to be a notorious gun-runner who deals heavily in Kalashnikovs (AK 47 assault rifles). ""Ninety"", who is reported to be worth millions of US dollars, was said, during the year he lived in Jamaica, to have surrounded himself with police personnel whom he used for his enforcement and cocaine transhipment activities. The Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (the ""Kingpin Act"") targets worldwide, significant foreign narcotics traffickers, their organisations, and operatives. The Kingpin Act is the result of legislation the purpose of which is to deny significant foreign narcotics traffickers, their related businesses, and their operatives access to the US financial system and all trade and transactions involving US companies and individuals. The Kingpin Act authorises the President to take these actions when he determines that a foreign narcotics trafficker presents a threat to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States. Congress modelled the Kingpin Act after the effective sanctions programme that the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (""OFAC"") administers against the Colombian drug cartels pursuant to Executive Order 12978 issued in October 1995 under authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The Kingpin Act requires that the Departments of Treasury, State, Justice and Defence, and the Director of Central Intelligence, co-ordinate on the identification of proposed kingpins for designation by the President. By June 1 each year, the President must report to specified congressional committees those ""foreign persons [he] determines are appropriate for sanctions"" and stating his intent to impose sanctions upon those foreign persons. The long-term effectiveness of the Kingpin Act is enhanced by the Department of the Treasury's authority (in consultation with appropriate government agencies and departments) to make derivative designations of foreign individuals and entities providing specified types of support or assistance to designated traffickers. This authority broadens the scope of application of the economic sanctions against designated kingpins to include their businesses and operatives. In addition, designated individuals and immediate family members who have knowingly benefited from the designated individuals' illicit activity will be denied visas to the United States under 8 U.S.C. 1182 (a)(2)(C). The Kingpin Act provides for criminal penalties of up to 10 years' imprisonment for individuals and up to a $10-million fine for entities for violations, as well as a maximum of 30 years' imprisonment and/or a $5-million fine for officers, directors or agents of entities who knowingly participate in violations. The Kingpin Act also provides for civil penalties of up to $1 million. Other foreign persons that the President has determined are appropriate for sanctions pursuant to the Kingpin Act are: Ismael Zambada Garcia and Mario Ernesto Villanueva Madrid both of whom are citizens of Mexico; Luis Fernando Da Costa who is a citizen of Brazil; Oded Tuito who holds Israeli and French citizenship, and Haji Ibrahim who is a citizen of Pakistan. These names are being added to the designations announced by President Clinton in June 2000 and President Bush in June 2001. The initial designations were: Benjamin Alberto Arellano-Felix; Ramon Eduardo Arellano-Felix; Jose de Jesus Amezcua-Contreras; Luis Ignacio Amezcua-Contreras; Rafael Caro-Quintero; Vicente Carrillo-Fuentes; Chang Chi-Fu; Wei Hsueh-Kang; Noel Timothy Heath; Glenroy Vingrove Matthews; Abeni 0.

"TOP Ships Inc. (TOPS) Stock Price, Quote, History & News",finance.yahoo.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TOPS/,26-07-20 0:00,"SmarterAnalyst
Any risk-tolerant investor will be hard pressed to find a penny stock that better embodies the description than Greek oil tanker operator Top Ships (TOPS). Shares are going for $0.11 apiece, after a multi-year ride to the bottom. In 2020 alone, the stock is down by 86% so far. Adding insult to injury, the only analyst on Wall Street keeping a close eye on the vessel operator recently downgraded his rating.Maxim analyst Tate Sullivan dropped his rating from Buy to Hold and also removed his price target, citing “potential for delays at shipyards delivering five new ships to TOPS in 2021” as the reason for the downbeat assessment. (To watch Sullivan’s track record, click here)The analyst further said, “While COVID-19 may continue to impact global shipping and shipyard activity in 2021, we note shipyards periodically have newbuild delivery delays even during more predictable operating environments. In addition to potential delays in 2021 generating revenue from five new ships, we also factor in the risk that some of TOPS' customers may not exercise options on contracts with ‘end of firm period’ contracts in 2021.”There are four ships in the company’s fleet that fall into this category. According to Tate, this could result in “lower daily rates and/or downtime between contracts if volatility in global shipping activity continues.”Therefore, Sullivan trimmed his 2021 revenue estimate from $68.7 million to $66.9 million, and slashed his previous 2021 EBITDA estimate from $31.4 million to $30.4 million.In order to raise additional cash, since the turn of the year, Top Ships has completed a series of equity offerings, with net proceeds coming in at about $113.7 million. Sullivan estimates that in the first half of 2020, $41.4 million went toward reducing the debt load, but he still expects debt to increase to $374.6 million by the end of 2021 (compared to the previous 2021 estimate of $348.3 million).In addition, Sullivan believes TOPS will preserve cash before paying for newbuilds, although the analyst expects TOPS to fund newbuild construction with proceeds from the equity offerings.Looking ahead, a revision of Sullivan’s outlook for the vessel operator is dependent upon the health of the global shipping industry.“We will continue to review our estimates as a meaningful increase in shipping activity in 2021 may lead customers for four of TOPS' ships to exercise options at higher daily contract rates,” the analyst concluded.

Konstantin Malofeev,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstantin_Malofeev#Legal_issues,05-09-13 19:46,"Konstantin Valeryevich Malofeev (Russian: Константин Валерьевич Малофеев) is a Russian businessman, chairman of non-government organisation Society for the development of Russian historical education Double-Headed Eagle.[1][2] He is chairman of the Board of Directors of the media group Tsargrad, founder of the international investment fund Marshall Capital Partners,[3] member of the board of trustees of the non-profit partnership Safe Internet League[4][5] and Chairman of the Saint Basil the Great Charitable Foundation [ru].
Early life and education [ edit ]
Malofeev was born on 3 July 1974 in the town of Pushchino in the Moscow region where he went to the local school, followed by art college. In 1996, he graduated with a law degree from Moscow State University.[6]
Career [ edit ]
Konstantin Malofeev is the founder of Marshall Capital, one of the leading Russian investment groups. He has worked in private equity, investment banking and corporate finance for more than 15 years.
Malofeev began his career in 1996 in the investment bank Renaissance Capital and after it held various senior positions with Interros, MDM Bank and other investment banks and groups. From 2002 to 2004, he was the Head of Corporate Finance at MDM Bank, a leading Russian investment bank where he successfully built-up the bank's M&A practice.
Founded in 2005 by Malofeev, Marshall Capital is a Russian investment group focusing on equity and direct investments in telecommunications, media and technology, as well as real estate and agriculture. Late in 2014, Marshall Capital passed under the management of the fund CFG Capital (France), private European investor focused on investment projects in Russia and the CIS. The partnership agreement created a joint business CFG Marshall with the overall size of the planned investments of more than €2 billion.
Malofeev is the Chairman of the board of directors of the group Tsargrad, a platform used by such people as Alex Jones and Aleksandr Dugin. Malofeev is also the president of and a supervisory board member for Katehon, a right-wing think tank. Additionally, Malofeev has ties to the American religious right. He hired former Fox News employee Jack Hannick to help launch Tsargrad TV.[7]
In addition, Malofeev is a philanthropist who supports cultural and social projects. He is the founder of the largest Russian private foundation, St. Basil the Great Charitable Foundation. Malofeev is a member of the board of trustees of the non-profit partnership ""Safe Internet League"", a Russian non-governmental organization created to censor information on the Internet, and the Chairman of the Supervisory Board of College St. Basil the Great, founded by him in 2007.
Business [ edit ]
Marshall Capital Group is a Russian holding company, with investments in a diverse range of industries, including telecommunications, media and technology, as well as real estate and agriculture.
One of Marshall Capital Group's biggest investments is a 10.7 per cent stake in Rostelecom, a nationwide telecommunications enterprise and the largest universal communications operator in Russia, serving more than 100 million subscribers in 80 regions.[8]
With French politician/businessman Philippe de Villiers, Malofeev is set to build two Russian history related theme parks; one in Moscow and one in Yalta.[9]
Politics [ edit ]
On 17 October 2012, Malofeev announced his candidacy and on 18 November was elected to the Council of Deputies of Znamenskoye Rural Settlement of Ugransky District in Smolensk Oblast, winning a majority vote (74.85%).[10] His election took place despite the Vyazem regional court in Smolensk having annulled Malofeev's candidacy and removed him from the ballot on charges of electoral corruption.[11] The court concluded that Malofeev had offered to pay 500 Roubles for each vote committed to him.
Legal issues [ edit ]
In 2007, VTB Capital plc, a subsidiary of VTB Bank began a legal case against Marshall Capital and Malofeev concerning a loan by ""Russagroprom"" Ltd. of US$225 million for the purchase of six dairy plants and three associated companies from ""Nutritek"". VTB Capital questioned the accuracy of the valuation of the dairy plants and the relationship between Marshall Capital and Malofeev, with both Russagroprom and Nutritek, asking the Court to place a world freezing order on Malofeev's assets. In turn, VTB Capital's own due diligence procedures prior to the acquisition were brought under scrutiny.
In a Judgment at the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom on 6 February 2013 Marshall Capital and Malofeev were fully acquitted of all allegations made by VTB Capital. VTB Capital was also criticised by the judge for its due diligence practices and its ""apparent failures"" and ""inappropriate...protracted wrongful continuation"" of its world freezing order.[12][13]
In July 2014, Ukraine opened a criminal case against Malofeev; he was accused of financing ""illegal military groups"" in Eastern Ukraine who at the time fought against the Ukrainian army.[14] For this he was also placed on the European Union list of individuals sanctioned during the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine.[9] On 19 December 2014 he, and his company Marshall Capital Partners, were also placed on the OFAC Specially Designated Nationals List in the United States.
On 12 February 2015, Russian law enforcement searched apartments of Malofeev and his business partner Dmitry Skuratov related to the VTB case.[15]
On 11 September 2019 Bulgarian government banned him from entering the country for ten years over an alleged spying conspiracy aimed at turning the country away from its pro-Western orientation and further toward Moscow.[16]
Involvement in the War in Donbass [ edit ]
The European Commission, the United States and Ukraine have accused Malofeev of trying to destabilize and financing separatism in Ukraine.[17] [18] According to EU Regulation No 826/2014 from 30 July 2014, Malofeev is closely linked to Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine and Crimea. He was the former employer of Alexander Borodai, the so-called Prime Minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic. Malofeev was also former employer of Igor Girkin, a former FSB colonel who provided security services to Malofeev's visits to Kiev and Crimea in the weeks before the annexation of the latter by Russia.[19]
Igor Girkin later reappeared as the leader of the separatist insurgency in the town of Slovyansk, and subsequently as the self-proclaimed Minister of Defense of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic. In May 2014, during the separatists' occupation of Slovyansk led by Girkin, the Ukrainian security services SBU intercepted a phone call,[20] in which a person with the same first and patronymic names as Malofeev's, and a voice similar to his own, provides tactical military intelligence to Girkin and praises him for a recent ambush attack on Ukrainian anti-terrorism troops.
In February 2015, the Russian investigative newspaper Novaya Gazeta published a document,[21] which the newspaper alleged was a strategy for fomenting unrest in, and annexing Crimea, as well as other areas in South-Eastern Ukraine. The newspaper's editor-in-chief has publicly stated that the unnamed sources which leaked the alleged strategy, have informed the paper that Malofeev and his team had authored the document in February 2014. Also in 2014 hacker group Shaltay Boltay published leaked emails of George Gavrish, a nationalist closely cooperating with Alexander Dugin, suggesting wide range of financial support flowing from Malofeev's conservative funds to radical nationalist political movements in Europe.[22] In May 2014, Malofeev organized a meeting in Vienna with FPO, Ataka and Front National.[23] A majority of that funding is funneled through the Saint Basil the Great Charitable Fund operated by Malofeev.[24]
In public statements, Malofeev has disclaimed his active involvement with armed groups in Ukraine, and has said that his financial contributions to the areas of unrest in Ukraine has been limited to humanitarian aid. He has also said that his employment link to two of the key Russian participants in the armed insurgency in Eastern Ukraine is a coincidence. Malofeev has never commented on the audio recording which purports to evidence his hands-on involvement with the armed attacks on Ukrainian armed forces.[citation needed]
While all of Malofeev's initiatives in Ukraine were, formally, privately organized and funded, intercepted phone calls between him and his lieutenants on the ground in Ukraine, as well as hacked email correspondence, showed that he closely coordinated his actions with the Kremlin, at times via the powerful Orthodox priest Bishop Tikhon whom Malofeev and Putin (in their own words) share as spiritual adviser; at other times via direct coordination between Malofeev and Putin's advisers Vladislav Surkov and Sergey Glazyev, but also via Malofeev's close collaboration with the Kremlin-owned Russian Institute for Strategic Studies (RIIS), chaired by former KGB/SVR Gen. Leonid Reshetnikov. In addition, a recent email hack that we have reviewed suggests that at least one employee of Malofeev's participated in non-public sessions of the Russian government.[25]
Family [ edit ]
Malofeev is married to Irina Vilter, a lawyer at Monastyrsky, Zyuba, Stepanov & Partners.[26] They have three children.
Social activity [ edit ]
Malofeev is involved in a number of projects, providing funding, both personally and through Marshall Capital.
In January 2007, Malofeev co-founded St. Basil the Great Grammar School, providing traditional Russian schooling.[27]
In July 2007, he established the Russian Society of Philanthropists for the Protection of Mothers and Children. One of the society's initial programmes, The Heart of the Child, funds treatment for children with congenital heart defects in specialist Russian clinics.[28]
In June 2010, the Society was renamed the Charitable Foundation of St Basil the Great. Its focus is to improve children's health, develop education and training, as well as constructing, restoring and financially supporting the development and growth of the Russian Orthodox Church. The Foundation is involved in over 30 programmes across Russia.

Annual CPI rate was 10.94 percent and PPI rate was 6.71 percent.
Annual CPI rates, which have been around 10 percent since 2004, increased with the 2018 exchange rate shock and became 19.50 percent annually in April last year. The annual Yi-PPI rate had also increased by 30.12 percent.

April 2020 inflation related findings;
1. April inflation is an important indicator for 2020 year-end inflation. Because the extraordinary situation has been added to the factors affecting inflation. Despite this, inflation continued in double digits.
2. coronavirus crisis in the world, creating a risk of deflation, inflation in Turkey continues. Besides Turkey also it made stock in panic because of the crisis. Cash demand of households increased. The number of unemployed has increased. Under these conditions, total demand should have narrowed and inflation pressure should have decreased. This means that Turkey does not work in terms of market competition.
3. The increase in budget deficits, the Central Bank’s widening of the money supply and the exchange rate increases affected the April 2020 inflation. Increasing food demand for food stocks has led to higher food inflation.
4. In April 2019, the CPI rate was 19.50 percent. As it is higher, the CPI rate in April 2020 is lower with the base effect. As the trend of inflation and more accurate inflation rate eliminates such effects 12-month average inflation it shows more clearly. This rate is 12.66 percent and is above the annual CPI.
Rent increases are legally based on 12-month average inflation. Thus, rents can be increased by a maximum of 12.66 percent in May.
5. In April, monthly food, 2.53 percent, clothing and footwear 6.95 percent, household goods rose 1.09 percent, above the monthly CPI rate. Their share in the spending basket, which is the basis for the CPI, keeps 37.49 percent. However, the share of low income groups in the spending basket is around 80 percent. This means that the April inflation (CPI rate) of the low income group is higher.
6. In April, energy prices fell by 11.25 percent year-on-year. Since energy was input in all production, it should have reduced inflation. Despite this, inflation continued in double digits. If energy prices did not fall, the inflation rate would be higher.
7. The April-PPI rate is higher than the CPI rate in April. In April, the increase in exchange rate was effective in the high level of D-PPI. The increase in the exchange rate caused the increase in imported input prices, which increased the production costs. This cost increase will be reflected in retail prices (CPI) in the coming months.

All Is Not Well in Novorossiya,foreignpolicy.com,https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/07/12/all-is-not-well-in-novorossiya/,12-07-14 1:34,"All Is Not Well in Novorossiya
In the week since eastern Ukraine’s pro-Russian separatists withdrew from Slavyansk on July 5, ceding control of their de facto capital to Ukrainian armed forces, their allies in Russia have begun to turn on them. The rebels repaired to Donetsk, some 70 miles to the south, where they burrowed into the civilian infrastructure and, more or less, vowed to use residents as human shields against a feared Ukrainian invasion.
""Who lost Slavyansk?"" has become the question on the lips of every proponent of the revanchist project to establish and expand ""Novorossiya,"" the once Russian-conquered lands of the Black Sea region, of which east and southeast Ukraine are crucial constituents. Accusations of betrayal and cowardice leveled against the separatists have been met by counter-accusations that Russian President Vladimir Putin egged on a movement he did not sufficiently support militarily and now seeks to abandon. But the merry-go-round of recriminations is exposing interesting disclosures and hypotheses for what the Kremlin is now playing at in eastern Ukraine.
Most of the furor and speculation centers on the heavily scrutinized figure of Col. Igor Strelkov. Strelkov, whose real name is Igor Girkin, is a Russian national and the self-styled ""defense minister"" of the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), a position that entailed leading the rebel troops in operations across eastern Ukraine. Many suspect that Strelkov, who was born in Moscow, is an active or reserve officer in the GRU, Russia’s military intelligence agency. (The European Union sanctioned the colonel in April on charges he worked for the GRU.) He’s said to have fought in Serbia, Chechnya, and Transnistria. Documents recently discovered by reporters at the abandoned separatist headquarters in Slavyansk indicate that Strelkov had also presided over a system of Stalin-like summary justice.
Over the past few months, reactionary Russians lionized Strelkov as a stalwart enemy of the ""fascist junta"" in Kiev and the ringleader of the separatist cause. A popular online meme had him fronting a Photoshopped version of the movie poster for 300, the adaptation of the pulp comic book about Sparta’s small but formidable defense against the conquering Persian army. (It’s likely an image that Strelkov himself would embrace. Historical re-enactment is Strelkov’s hobby, and he has played Leonidas, the Spartan commander, before.)
But how quickly Greek heroes transform into treacherous wimps.
Within days, some of the colonel’s friends had given up on him. The left-wing Russian ultranationalist theater director and Soviet nostalgic Sergey Kurginyan denounced the ""surrender"" of the city as a ""war crime."" He dismissed Strelkov’s perennial complaint that Russia was not supplying the rebels with weapons or materials. In a speech in Moscow, Kurginyan declaimed: ""All of that pathetic fable that ‘they’re not helping me,’ ‘they’re not helping me,’ ‘they’re not helping me.’ Recently, he began to receive everything. You understand? Everything that is needed for a warrior.""
Pavel Gubarev, the ""people’s governor of Donetsk,"" was having none of this criticism of his defense minister. Firing back at Kurginyan, Gubarev posted to VKontakte (Russia’s version of Facebook): ""Any person who criticizes the Commander-in-Chief during war time is a criminal. All the more because this person has no grasp at all on the REAL facts of the ground war, and is relying on certain mythical ‘facts’ known to him alone. And on the whole, it is hard to accept military criticism from a theater director. Most likely these are other people’s thoughts which were whispered to Kurginyan by enemies of Novorossiya."" Gubarev went on to elaborate at a rally in Donetsk on July 6 that the ""tactical retreat"" was in order to ""protect Slavyansk’s civilian population"" and was ""the necessary and brilliant move by General Strelkov.""
But on July 8, Kurginyan held his own ""press conference"" in Donetsk. A bizarre spectacle, even by Russian standards, this affair featured the ultranationalist activist berating the cowards and turncoats under Strelkov’s command without seeming to realize that he was talking directly to two of them: Gubarev himself and Igor Bezler, a pro-Russian military commander based in Gorlovka, a town just to Donetsk’s northeast. In the course of denouncing the turncoats of Slavyansk, Kurginyan made a further admission in relation to Russia’s supply of weaponry to the separatists — which Bezler, a GRU lieutenant colonel and one of the most gruesome rebel leaders in Ukraine, confirmed.
""Russian technical assistance has been supplied by the citizenry, not by the government,"" Kurginyan said. ""Yes, in the beginning, it went horribly. And you did really receive very bad stuff, one out of four not working and so on. But in the last two to three weeks, the situation drastically changed for the better."" To this came Bezler’s crucial reply: ""We’re talking here about only three tanks and three BTRs [armored personnel carriers]. For Slavyansk.""
Kurginyan went on to say that while it was true that Russia’s material support for the rebels was lackluster prior to July 3 — two days before their routing in Slavyansk — since then, the disbursal of lethal aid has improved dramatically and will improve even more: ""One of my tasks is to convince Russian civil society to get you more Fagots [anti-aircraft missiles], Kornets [anti-tank missiles] and Iglas [anti-aircraft missiles].""
The press conference ended with Gubarev and Bezler storming out on Kurginyan. But what was disclosed beforehand certainly wasn’t lost on Kiev.
A few weeks ago, the government of newly elected Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko alleged that Russia had sent armored vehicles, including at least three T-64 tanks, into Ukraine. The U.S. State Department confirmed the charge, and NATO lent added credence to it, citing satellite footage. Kiev also claimed that Russia was sending anti-aircraft and anti-tank missiles that were being used to shoot down Ukrainian helicopters and military transport planes. Moscow strenuously denied it had supplied any such weapons.
Kurginyan’s assertion that any heavy-duty hardware dispatched into eastern Ukraine came from Russia’s ""civil society"" and not the government was an obvious falsehood — unless NGOs have access to armored vehicles and MANPADS. But here, at last, was Bezler himself conceding that the separatists had received tanks and BTRs from Russia, and a Russian representative reassuring him that ""more"" anti-aircraft and anti-tank missiles were on their way. These acknowledgements constituted a ""gotcha"" moment for Andriy Lysenko, the spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council, who concluded that this press conference verified what Ukraine has been saying all along about Putin’s clandestine war.
Given the absurdist nature of the event — orchestrated by a theater director no less — many wondered whether Kurginyan’s lines were spontaneous or scripted propaganda.
On first glance, by admitting publicly to the weapons transfers, Kurginyan and Bezler played directly into the hands of NATO, the United States, and Ukraine, while also making Putin look like a liar. But from Donetsk, the propaganda value is clear, too: it hints at Moscow’s escalation of support to the separatists, who need a morale boost after their defeat at Slavyansk.
There is evidence to support both theories. On July 11, the Ukrainian government said that at least 30 of its soldiers were killed in a Grad rocket attack south of Luhansk, close to the border with Russia. (The body count was later revised to 19.) Ukrainian officials suggested that the rocket may have actually been fired from within Russia. Videos have also emerged showing DPR militants toting 9K35 Strela-10 vehicle-mounted anti-aircraft missiles in Donetsk — advanced systems that are not, according to RIA Novosti, among those confiscated by separatists from the Ukrainian military. If confirmed, these events would suggest that Russian support is escalating.
Andriy Parubiy, a spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council, offered his own interpretation of what the press conference signified — at a talk hosted this week by the Atlantic Council in Washington, D.C.. The disparagement of Strelkov, he said, was the result of an internal spat between separatist factions vying for Putin’s attention and succor. Strelkov ""had received large amounts of money from the Kremlin and was not appropriately sharing it with the various other leaders,"" Parubiy said. ""This tension has become highlighted as it seems that Russia may be quietly ignoring pleas for more help from separatists holed up in Donetsk.""
Russian journalist Evgeny Gilbo, an expert on nationalist and separatist movements, thinks that the public airing of mutual resentment was an elaborate hoax. Kurginyan and Strelkov, he wrote, are now ""shuttling around Donbass [the region encompassing Donetsk and Luhansk] in attempts to consolidate the resistance groups."" The endgame is to limit the separatists’ ambitions to the staking out of an ""independent Novorossiya, friendly and loyal to the [Russian Federation].""
In either case, it would seem that Strelkov is still very much large and in charge in Donbass. But other interpretations of recent events suggest that the fortunes of Ukraine’s erstwhile Leonidas are on the wane.
For one thing, figures close to the Kremlin are fed up with him. Eduard Bagirov, one of Putin’s former campaign managers, knows something about staging pro-Russian provocations in European countries. In 2011, he was arrested in Chisinau, Moldova, for organizing pro-Kremlin demonstrations and was then subsequently placed under house arrest, from which he fled in the trunk of a car. Bagirov posted to Facebook this week that Strelkov was a petty upstart compared with Putin: ""I will never have a positive attitude to a person who tries to undercut Putin with obvious provocations or provocative statements. Really, I’m wildly furious at this rudeness.""
Bagirov suggested that Strelkov wasn’t really fighting for Moscow at all, but for himself or possibly the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, a reactionary and ultranationalist ""opposition"" party that has shipped at least one armored truck to the separatists already. ""[F]or me,"" Bagirov wrote, ""Russia is more primary than Donbass; in general I believe that Donbass is not our Russian Crimea, and under no circumstances does Russia need this crap at all, and we are not at all obliged to fight there at all.""
If one of Putin’s former campaign managers now believes that this once-prized territory is now expendable to Russia’s broader goal of founding Novorossiya, then it may be that the Kremlin’s mainstream constituency is beginning to tire of the war.
Another eyebrow-raising development, this one in Russia, was the sacking of Alexander Dugin from his post at Moscow State University in late June. The Rasputin-bearded Dugin, the country’s foremost philosopher of ""Eurasianism,"" has been the most ardent cheerleader not just for the separatist cause, but for Russia’s outright invasion and annexation of eastern Ukraine. Now, though, he’s out of a job at the most elite Russian university, a termination that couldn’t have happened without political pressure from the top. Dugin’s fall from grace could mean that yesterday’s useful pro-war ideologue has suddenly become today’s dangerous subversive. Dugin was fired before the fall of Slavyansk, but he remains one of the separatists’ most outspoken admirers.
Other voices in the Russian media have begun to defend Strelkov as a hero who was betrayed by the Motherland. Some have even cast him as viable political alternative — not to Poroshenko, but to Putin. Egor Prosvirnin, an ultranationalist who edits the website ""Sputnik and Pogrom,"" went on a popular talk show this week to suggest that Strelkov would make a better opposition presidential candidate than either Alexey Navalny, the de facto leader of Russia’s opposition, or Boris Nemtsov, the former first deputy prime minister under Putin who then became a long-standing critic of the regime.
Nemtsov, while not quite agreeing with Prosvirnin’s endorsement, nevertheless agreed that Strelkov represents a direct threat to Putin’s power. ""Putin perfectly well understands that after the end of the war (and it will inevitably end) Strelkov and his comrades-at-arms will return to Russia,"" he wrote on Facebook. ""They will return very angry, since they believe and rightly so, that Putin has betrayed them. He did not take Donbass into its fold, he did not send in forces. He provided some help, but not what had been expected. Except for the journalists, he abandoned those killed in Donetsk and Luhansk and did not help the families of those who died. Putin is a traitor, cad, and fraud.""
Bathing Strelkov in such a patriotic light, in contrast to the ne plus ultra of patriotism who resides in the Kremlin, isn’t likely to do the military commander any favors in the long term — especially if he starts to embrace his good press.
No episode of speculative Kremlinology would be complete without mentioning Russia’s ""grey cardinal"" — Vladislav Surkov — the mastermind of Russia’s response to the Maidan protest movement and an architect of its ongoing shenanigans in eastern Ukraine. (He was sanctioned by the United States in March, much to his disdainful amusement.)
According to Boris Rozhin, editor of the Russian newspaper Golos Sevastopolya and a well-known blogger, Surkov is behind the campaign now directed against Strelkov. Surkov, Rozhin says, is surreptitiously trying to broker a deal with Kiev and the West to end the war entirely by peacefully transforming Donbass into something similar to Moldova’s Transnistria — a Russian-controlled exclave on Ukrainian soil. Kiev’s supposed interlocutor with Surkov for this grand bargain is Rinat Akhmetov, the oligarch and mining magnate of Donbass accused of paying off the separatists earlier in the rebellion to keep the peace. Akhmetov then appeared to hedge his bets in May, calling on Ukraine’s new government to ""fight, fight, fight"" his own ostensible clients.
As Rozhin argued on his LiveJournal blog: ""The problem of the DPR is essentially that Akhmetov still has a major influence on the leadership of the DPR and the Donetsk elites. Moscow is taking this point into account and trying to come to an agreement with him (through Surkov and a number of other officials)."" But, says Rozhin, Strelkov’s last stand at Donetsk is undermining any hopes of reaching an agreement. If a protracted battle breaks out in Donetsk, Ukraine’s second-largest industrial city, Akhmetov’s properties, factories, and assets now stand to be powdered in a devastating and lengthy war of attrition, giving Surkov little to barter with. For a deal to go through, Strelkov’s intransigence must be stopped.
This conspiratorial scenario — with Russia’s Ginsberg-and-Tupac-loving political technologist at the center of Ukrainian decision-making — may seem far-fetched, but it has at least one prominent proponent in Dugin. The Eurasianist guru not only sees Surkov’s invisible hand trying to restrain Strelkov but has developed this accusation into a new us-versus-them dichotomy in the Russian domestic argument about Ukraine. By Dugin’s lights, Strelkov and his troops in Donetsk now constitute the ""party of war,"" while Surkov, whom Dugin also blames for his dismissal from Moscow State University, heads up the ""party of defeatists.""
Strelkov faces other challenges too, including competition for the role of Russia’s most-favored separatist leader.
Alexander Khodakovsky, a ""defector"" from the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and the former head of its Alfa division in Donetsk, is in charge of the Vostok Battalion, a separatist group that bears the same name of a disbanded Chechen unit overseen by the GRU. Last month, the battalion seized the DPR’s administrative building from the ragtag amateurs who had first overtaken it and were presumably under Strelkov’s command. As Mark Galeotti observed on Foreign Policy recently, the Vostok Battalion’s presence in Donbass is the starkest signal yet of Putin’s desire to impose GRU supervision on the Strelkovites, using battle-hardened commandos from the Caucasus and Russia’s revivified military intelligence apparatus. Khodakovsky has already split with Strelkov, describing him as more of an equal than superior and as a summer solider who can return to Russia whenever he wants. ""There cannot be a single leader giving orders,"" Khodakovsky said on July 10 in Makiivka, the town just beyond Donetsk where the Vostok Battalion is now holed up. ""Because if Strelkov suddenly decides what he wants is — in the interests of protecting the lives of Donetsk citizens and the lives of militiamen — to abandon Donetsk, then we will not follow his orders.""
Gazeta.ru reporter Vladimir Dergachev has suggested that Khodakovsky is Akhmetov’s favored rebel: ""[H]e prevented the nationalization of Akhmetov’s assets, it is his people who guarding Kurginyan himself [in Donetsk]."" Dergachev made these remarks in an interview with Alexander Borodai, the self-proclaimed ""prime minister"" of the DPR, on July 6, while Borodai was in Moscow seeking greater aid from the Kremlin. Borodai denied that Khodakovsky was tied in any way to Akhmetov; he denied that Surkov was of the ""party of doves""; and he denied that Strelkov was still anything other than ""the leader for the whole republic.""
Whatever is really going on behind the scenes, a schism is undeniably emerging in Russia over how to proceed in Ukraine.
Putin put Russians on a paranoid and jingoistic war-footing for months with a 24-hour news cycle of denunciations of the ""gay Nazis in Kiev taking orders from the State Department,"" the manufacture of alleged Ukrainian atrocities (based on images that were often of Russian atrocities in Chechnya and elsewhere), and Soviet-levels of disinformation and propaganda. Lowering the temperature on a national fever isn’t easy. While Russian polling data suggests that as much as two-thirds of the population opposes military intervention, and the state-run media has begun treating the conflict more as a bloody stalemate than sure path to victory, the neo-imperialists are now furious at the man who led them on.
Dugin has said that ""Russian patriots are close to turning away"" from Putin, though his estimate and definition of what a Russian patriot is may be questionable. Mikhail Aleksandrov, a researcher at Moscow State Institute for International Relations, says that not going to war in Ukraine might prove ""catastrophic"" for Putin because his ""support by a significant part of society was based on his defense of national interests"" and he himself made protecting the ""Russian-speaking populations"" of Ukraine just such an interest.
As ever, Moscow’s foreign policy is inextricable from domestic politics. The gravest threat to Putin has always been from his right, the blood-and-soil nationalists who, over the course of almost 15 years in power, he has encouraged, underwritten, criticized, and tried to contain at home — often simultaneously. But now some of those challengers are running around Ukraine with tanks and anti-aircraft missiles. At home, they are screaming for blood.

In the week since eastern Ukraine’s pro-Russian separatists withdrew from Slavyansk on July 5, ceding control of their de facto capital to Ukrainian armed forces, their allies in Russia have begun to turn on them. The European Union sanctioned the colonel in April on charges he worked for the GRU.) It’s likely an image that Strelkov himself would embrace. But how quickly Greek heroes transform into treacherous wimps. Within days, some of the colonel’s friends had given up on him. Everything that is needed for a warrior."" And on the whole, it is hard to accept military criticism from a theater director. Most likely these are other people’s thoughts which were whispered to Kurginyan by enemies of Novorossiya."" A bizarre spectacle, even by Russian standards, this affair featured the ultranationalist activist berating the cowards and turncoats under Strelkov’s command without seeming to realize that he was talking directly to two of them: Gubarev himself and Igor Bezler, a pro-Russian military commander based in Gorlovka, a town just to Donetsk’s northeast. ""Russian technical assistance has been supplied by the citizenry, not by the government,"" Kurginyan said. "" And you did really receive very bad stuff, one out of four not working and so on. But in the last two to three weeks, the situation drastically changed for the better."" To this came Bezler’s crucial reply: ""We’re talking here about only three tanks and three BTRs [armored personnel carriers]. For Slavyansk."" But what was disclosed beforehand certainly wasn’t lost on Kiev. Moscow strenuously denied it had supplied any such weapons. On first glance, by admitting publicly to the weapons transfers, Kurginyan and Bezler played directly into the hands of NATO, the United States, and Ukraine, while also making Putin look like a liar. Russian journalist Evgeny Gilbo, an expert on nationalist and separatist movements, thinks that the public airing of mutual resentment was an elaborate hoax. Eduard Bagirov, one of Putin’s former campaign managers, knows something about staging pro-Russian provocations in European countries. If one of Putin’s former campaign managers now believes that this once-prized territory is now expendable to Russia’s broader goal of founding Novorossiya, then it may be that the Kremlin’s mainstream constituency is beginning to tire of the war. They will return very angry, since they believe and rightly so, that Putin has betrayed them. He provided some help, but not what had been expected. As Rozhin argued on his LiveJournal blog: ""The problem of the DPR is essentially that Akhmetov still has a major influence on the leadership of the DPR and the Donetsk elites. As Mark Galeotti observed on Foreign Policy recently, the Vostok Battalion’s presence in Donbass is the starkest signal yet of Putin’s desire to impose GRU supervision on the Strelkovites, using battle-hardened commandos from the Caucasus and Russia’s revivified military intelligence apparatus. Gazeta.ru reporter Vladimir Dergachev has suggested that Khodakovsky is Akhmetov’s favored rebel: ""[H]e prevented the nationalization of Akhmetov’s assets, it is his people who guarding Kurginyan himself [in Donetsk]."" Dergachev made these remarks in an interview with Alexander Borodai, the self-proclaimed ""prime minister"" of the DPR, on July 6, while Borodai was in Moscow seeking greater aid from the Kremlin.","[{'name': 'Vladimir Dergachev'}, {'name': 'Mikhail Aleksandrov'}, {'name': 'Kornets'}, {'name': 'Iglas'}, {'name': 'Boris Rozhin'}, {'name': 'Leonidas'}, {'name': 'Vladimir Putin'}, {'name': 'Vladislav Surkov'}, {'name': 'Boris Nemtsov'}, {'name': 'Igor Strelkov'}, {'name': 'Petro Poroshenko'}, {'name': 'DPR'}, {'name': 'Alexander Dugin'}, {'name': 'Bathing Strelkov'}, {'name': 'Sergey Kurginyan'}, {'name': 'GRU'}, {'name': 'Luhansk'}, {'name': 'Gorlovka'}, {'name': 'Evgeny Gilbo'}, {'name': 'Donbass'}, {'name': 'Rinat Akhmetov'}, {'name': 'Andriy Parubiy'}, {'name': 'Golos Sevastopolya'}, {'name': 'Mark Galeotti'}, {'name': 'Alexander Borodai'}, {'name': 'Alexey Navalny'}, {'name': 'Alexander Khodakovsky'}, {'name': 'Rasputin'}, {'name': 'Igor Girkin'}, {'name': 'Kremlinology'}, {'name': 'Pavel Gubarev'}, {'name': 'Transnistria'}, {'name': 'Ginsberg'}, {'name': 'Gazeta.ru'}, {'name': 'Novorossiya'}, {'name': 'Slavyansk'}, {'name': 'Stalin'}, {'name': 'Igor Bezler'}, {'name': 'Egor Prosvirnin'}, {'name': 'Eduard Bagirov'}, {'name': 'Andriy Lysenko'}, {'name': 'Fagots'}, {'org_name': 'Donetsk'}, {'org_name': 'Kremlin'}, {'org_name': 'the Atlantic Council'}, {'org_name': 'The European Union'}, {'org_name': 'the Liberal Democratic Party'}, {'org_name': 'LiveJournal'}, {'org_name': 'Facebook'}, {'org_name': 'Akhmetov'}, {'org_name': 'Borodai'}, {'org_name': 'H]e'}, {'org_name': 'DPR'}, {'org_name': 'the Security Service of Ukraine'}, {'org_name': 'Foreign Policy'}, {'org_name': 'The U.S. State Department'}, {'org_name': 'GRU'}, {'org_name': 'the [Russian Federation]'}, {'org_name': 'SBU'}, {'org_name': 'Bezler'}, {'org_name': 'the State Department'}, {'org_name': 'the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council'}, {'org_name': 'Moscow State University'}, {'org_name': 'NATO'}, {'org_name': 'Dugin'}, {'org_name': 'the Vostok Battalion’s'}, {'org_name': 'Strelkovites'}, {'org_name': 'Prosvirnin'}, {'org_name': 'Kurginyan'}, {'org_name': 'Moscow State Institute for International Relations'}, {'org_name': 'RIA Novosti'}, {'org_name': 'VKontakte'}, {'org_name': 'Alfa'}, {'org_name': 'Surkov'}, {'org_name': 'Novorossiya'}, {'org_name': 'Slavyansk'}]",

The Glenn College offers undergraduate, graduate and doctoral programs in public affairs. The Glenn College provides research, training and technical assistance to state, public and nonprofit organizations. The college is named after United States Senator and Astronaut John Glenn. On January 30, 2015, the Ohio State University Board of Trustees approved a change of status of the former John Glenn School of Public Affairs making the new John Glenn College of Public Affairs the 15th college at The Ohio State University.

Page Hall [ edit ]
The Glenn College is located in Page Hall, a building initially opened in 1903 and occupied by the law school, the business school, offices of the Ohio Department of Health, the old College of Commerce and Journalism (the school of public administration that is a component of the John Glenn School was part of the College of Commerce), and the College of Music.
The predecessor John Glenn Institute moved into Page Hall after its 2003–2005 renovation.[6] The $16 million renovation gutted the interior, leaving only the facade.[citation needed] A crowd of nearly 500 watched the rededication on March 3, 2005, with speeches delivered by former Senator John Glenn, Columbus Mayor Michael B. Coleman, Ohio Supreme Court Chief Justice Thomas J. Moyer, Ohio State President Karen A. Holbrook and Tami Longaberger, chair of the Ohio State Board of Trustees.[7]
Alumni [ edit ]
There are over 3,000 graduates of the school's various degree programs. The following is a list of some notable graduates.

Salvadorean war crimes suspect Montano on trial in Spain,www.bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52964104,08-06-20 19:48,"Image copyright EPA Image caption The ex-colonel battled for years against extradition to Spain from the US
A former military commander in El Salvador, Inocente Montano, has gone on trial in Madrid accused of ordering the murder of six Jesuit priests in 1989.
He was alone in the dock on Monday. A man suspected of shooting the priests, ex-Lt René Yusshy Mendoza, is helping prosecutors as a witness now.
Two Salvadorean women - a housekeeper and her daughter - were also murdered.
Five of the Jesuit priests were Spanish. Salvadorean troops were fighting leftist rebels at the time.
Prosecutors believe ex-Col Inocente Montano, a former deputy defence minister, was part of a far-right group in the military responsible for atrocities and opposed to any peace deal with the Farabundo Marti Liberation Front (FMLN).
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption A witness to the 1989 atrocity speaks out
He was extradited from the US in November 2017, having been charged, along with other Salvadorean officers, by a Spanish judge in 2011. He has denied wrongdoing.
He had moved to the US in 2002 and was in jail there for immigration fraud and perjury when the Spanish extradition request was made.
One of the murdered priests, Ignacio Ellacuria, was rector of the Central American University (UCA) in the capital San Salvador and a leading figure in the liberation theology movement, which reached out to the poor of Latin America.
The priests and the two women were dragged from their beds early on 16 November, 1989, and murdered on the university campus.
In 1989 the civil war had escalated into street fighting between the FMLN rebels and the army in San Salvador.
Prosecutors are calling for 150 years in jail for Mr Montano, accusing him of having ""given the direct order to assassinate the Jesuits"".
He is expected to make a statement in court on Wednesday.
Spain's Efe news agency reports that Mr Yusshy, one of the alleged killers, has expressed remorse and is giving evidence to prosecutors in the case. He followed Monday's proceedings from the El Salvador consulate and is to testify on 7 July.
According to a 1993 UN Truth Commission report, more than 75,000 people were killed during the 12-year civil war.
A UN-brokered peace process ended the conflict in 1992, but a 1993 amnesty law meant that civil-war era human rights violations went unpunished.

Iranian state goes offline to dodge cyber-attacks,www.telegraph.co.uk,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/9453905/Iranian-state-goes-offline-to-dodge-cyber-attacks.html,05-08-12 0:00,"Reza Taghipour, the country's telecommunications minister, said the step was being taken because sensitive intelligence was vulnerable on the worldwide web, which he said was untrustworthy because it was controlled by ""one or two"" countries hostile to Iran .
""The establishment of the national intelligence network will create a situation where the precious intelligence of the country won't be accessible to these powers,"" Mr Taghipour told a conference on Sunday at Tehran's Amir Kabir University.
He described the move as the first phase of a project to replace the global internet with a domestic intranet system scheduled to be completed within 18 months.
Opponents have previously denounced the plan as a means of stamping out western influence on the internet while further tightening already stringent online surveillance of political activists and regime critics.
While Iranian officials have repeatedly spoken about creating their own alternative to the internet, the latest announcement follows the upheaval wreaked by Stuxnet and Flame, both of which are believed to have been developed jointly by the US and Israel.
Stuxnet, discovered in 2010, caused extensive damage to Iran's uranium enrichment programme, which Iran insists is peaceful despite the west's suspicions that it is designed to produce an atomic bomb.
Flame, detected this year, was an even more sophisticated virus that is believed to have targeted Iran's oil ministry and main export terminal.
Nima Rashedan, an Iranian cyber-security specialist based in the Czech Republic, said the domestic network was unlikely to be effective.

Haqqani Militants Act Like Pakistan’s Protected Partners,www.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/01/world/asia/haqqani-militants-act-like-pakistans-protected-partners.html,01-11-11 0:37,"Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and other senior administration officials visited Pakistan in October to demand that Pakistan’s spy agency either deliver the Haqqani network, a virulent part of the insurgency fighting American forces in Afghanistan, to the negotiating table or help fight them in their stronghold in Pakistan’s rugged tribal areas.
But there are any number of reasons why the Pakistanis may disappoint the Americans. Not least is that the Haqqani leadership — contrary to the American emphasis on drone strikes in the tribal areas — does not have to hide in Pakistan’s ungoverned fringes. So close are the Haqqanis’ ties to Pakistan’s military and intelligence service that one might just as well look for them around the capital, Islamabad, or in the closely guarded military quarters of Rawalpindi.
Osama bin Laden was thought to have been hiding in the tribal areas, too, said a tribal elder reached by telephone in the Haqqani stronghold of North Waziristan. Instead, Bin Laden was killed by American commandos in Abbottabad, a small city deep in Pakistan that is home to a top military academy. Whether he was there with the knowledge of Pakistan’s spy agency is still unclear.
“The Americans have taken the hell out of us through drones all these years trying to target O.B.L.,” said the elder, referring to Bin Laden, and not wanting to be named for fear of his safety. “But they found him in Abbottabad.

"Isis second in command killed in US raid, Pentagon says",www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/25/islamic-state-second-in-command-killed-us-raid-syria,25-03-16 15:29,"Abd al-Rahman Mustafa al-Qaduli, a high-profile Islamic State target for the US, was killed as part of US effort to ‘systematically eliminate Isis’s cabinet’
The Islamic State group’s second-in-command has been killed in a US raid, defence secretary Ash Carter announced on Friday.
Abd al-Rahman Mustafa al-Qaduli had been associated with Isis dating back to its earliest iteration as al-Qaida in Iraq, Carter told a news conference at the Pentagon. He was serving as finance minister and also responsible “for some external affairs and plots”.
Qaduli, reportedly about 57 years old, had been a high-profile target. The US had offered a bounty of up to $7m for information leading to him – the most for any Isis leader apart from Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who is valued at $10m.
Carter declined to say whether Qaduli had been killed by a drone strike or bombing raid involving manned aircraft and did not specify whether the attack occurred in Iraq or Syria. “I’m not going to say where and how it was done,” he said. “But the only thing I will say it is consistent with our strategy there which is to put pressure on Isil every single way we can, from the leadership right down to supporting local forces on the ground.”

He added that the US was “systematically eliminating” Isis’s cabinet, referring also to the killing earlier this month of Omar al-Shishani, known as “Omar the Chechen,” said to be effectively the jihadists’ defence minister. “The momentum of this campaign is now clearly on our side.”
Carter could not confirm whether Qaduli had any connection to this week’s terrorist attacks in Brussels, noting that the influence of such leaders ranges from direct training of fighters in Iraq and Syria to inspiring those abroad who are mostly self-motivated and self-radicalised.
“There’s no question that this individual and other individuals we’ve eliminated have been part of the apparatus of Isil to recruit and to motivate foreign fighters both to return from Iraq and Syria to countries in Europe and elsewhere and also simply by using the internet and other communications to do so.”
Facebook Twitter Pinterest The State Department’s Rewards For Justice wanted poster for Abd al-Rahman Mustafa al-Qaduli. Photograph: US State Department
Qaduli was born in the Iraqi city of Mosul, according to Iraqi security sources quoted by Agence France-Presse. He was in Afghanistan in the late 1990s. He joined al-Qaeda in 2004, and became a deputy to the al-Qaeda chief in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who was killed in 2006 by an American drone strike.
Qaduli was captured and imprisoned, but rejoined Isis in Syria after he was freed in 2012. Iraqi officials inaccurately reported that he was killed last April during a US airstrike in western Iraq.
Hisham al-Hashimi, an Iraqi scholar and author on Isis, said: “He was a real ideologue with lots of jihadi experience and influence on many fighters. Isis consider Baghdadi as the head of the body but [Qaduli] is the soul. This is a real shock to Isis.
Isis consider Baghdadi as the head of the body but [Qaduli] is the soul. This is a real shock to Isis Hisham al-Hashimi, Iraqi scholar
“[Qaduli] was in Afghanistan in 1998 and he met Bin Laden. He went back to Iraq in 2000 and lived in Sulaymaniyah and he swore allegiance to Ansar Al-Islam. In 2004, he gave allegiance to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and he was nominated to lead the Shura council (for Islamic State) in 2008.
“In 2010, Bin Laden assigned him to be the Emir of the organisation in Iraq but the Shura council went for Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi because the message from Bin Laden was late to arrive. In 2014, he effectively became Isis’s number two after the killing of Haji Bakr.”
The killing of Qaduli was welcomed in Washington. Democratic representative Adam Schiff, ranking member of the House select committee on intelligence, said: “Even as Isis perpetrates new outrages abroad, it’s so-called ‘caliphate’ is under increasing pressure, both in Syria and Iraq. This week’s successful targeting of Haji Imam is another step forward in the struggle against Isis and its brand of nihilistic jihad. Our intelligence in the region is improving, and Isis leaders know they are in the crosshairs.”
Carter, however, acknowledged that taking out Isis’s most senior figures, while valuable, would not necessarily change the course of the war. “Striking leadership is necessary but is far from sufficient,” he said. “Leaders can be replaced.
“However, these leaders have been around for a long time, they are senior, they’re experienced, and so eliminating them is an important objective and achieves an important result. But they will be replaced and we’ll continue to go after their leadership and other aspects of their capability.”
At the same briefing, the Pentagon leadership appeared to contradict previous comments about a new US marine base in Iraq and indicated that it anticipated a wave of US escalation of the war this spring.

The chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Marine General Joseph Dunford, said that marines at Fire Base Bell near Makhmour in northern Iraq had provided artillery fires for the forward advance of Iraqi forces as they prepare for a pivotal fight to retake Mosul, Iraq’s second city, from Isis.
Yet earlier this week, the spokesman for the US war command, Colonel Steve Warren, portrayed the purpose of the few hundred marines at the base as providing “force protection” for Iraqi forces and their US advisers if they come under attack from Isis, not offensive operations.
Isis rockets killed a US marine at the newly established outpost, the first US fire base of the war independent from Iraqi bases, over the weekend.
Dunford portrayed the artillery barrage as a trivial escalation, saying there was “no inconsistency between what this artillery unit did and what our aviation support does every day” in striking Isis from the air.
But Dunford and his boss, Carter, indicated that the US is likely to step up its involvement in the conflict.
They have provided Barack Obama with a palette of expanded military options, to include what Dunford called an “increase to US forces”, that they said Obama will decide on authorizing in the coming weeks.
The purpose of the escalation will be to support the Iraqi-led recapture of Mosul, although senior US officials, including the head of military intelligence, have doubted the Iraqi’s ability to take the city in 2016.
Asked to assess progress on the battlefield against Isis, Dunford warned: “While Isil has not been able to seize ground in the past several months, that hasn’t precluded them from conducting terrorist attacks and it hasn’t precluded them from conducting operations that are more akin to guerrilla operations than the conventional operations that we saw when they were seizing territory.
“I think there are a lot of reasons for us to be optimistic about the next several months but by no means would I say we’re about to break the back of Isil or that the fight is over.”",ABD AL-RAHMAN MUHAMMAD MUSTAFA AL-QADULI,25-03-16 15:29,659429ac8494083bfafc6849beb4793f031636d57e817f2150ddbdcca5137e01,0.71636188,"[{'score': 0.49972543120384216, 'topic': 'cyber'}]","[{'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.5107229351997375, 'name': 'Haji Imam', 'topic': 'terrorism'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.5193003416061401, 'name': 'Adam Schiff', 'topic': 'terrorism'}, {'sentiment': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.36247485876083374, 'name': 'Haji Bakr', 'topic': 'terrorism'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.5056615471839905, 'name': 'Joseph Dunford', 'topic': 'cyber'}, {'sentiment': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.3787952959537506, 'name': 'Steve Warren', 'topic': 'cyber'}, {'sentiment': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.3840671181678772, 'name': 'Steve Warren', 'topic': 'terrorism'}]","Abd al-Rahman Mustafa al-Qaduli, a high-profile Islamic State target for the US, was killed as part of US effort to ‘systematically eliminate Isis’s cabinet’

Salah Mohammed Abdah Tubaigy (Arabic: صلاح الطبيقي‎, born 20 August 1971),[1][3] also spelled Tubaiqi, is a Saudi forensic doctor. He was the head of the Saudi Scientific Council of Forensics[4] and a colonel in the armed forces of Saudi Arabia.[5]
In 2019, Tubaigy was sentenced to death for his involvement in the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi.[6].
Biography [ edit ]
Tubaigy was a professor in the criminal evidence department at Naif Arab University for Security Sciences in Riyadh, and was known for pioneering rapid and mobile autopsies. He taught and published papers on gathering DNA evidence and dissecting human bodies[7][8] and had a prominent role in Saudi Arabia’s state security apparatus and scientific community for around 20 years.[9] He designed a mobile autopsy lab to accompany Muslims on the hajj to Mecca, and said it can ""provide the dissection service to the security authorities in a record time.""[10]
In 2018 Al Jazeera reported that Tubaigy was involved in the murder and dismembering of Jamal Khashoggi.[2] A source said ""Tubaigy began to cut Khashoggi’s body up on a table in the study while he was still alive... As he started to dismember the body, Tubaigy put on earphones and listened to music. He advised other members of the squad to do the same.""[11][12]
An official cited by The New York Times reportedly described a quick assassination, and dismemberment by a team of Saudi agents, with a bone saw brought for the purpose. ""It is like Pulp Fiction,"" the official said.[13]
Tubaigy served on the editorial board to the King Fahd Security College. In late October 2018, his name was removed from the publication’s website.[14]
In April 2019, as a response to the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the United States banned Tubaigy and 15 others (including Saud al-Qahtani) from entering the country.[15]
On 23 December 2019, Tubaigy was one of five people sentenced to death for carrying out Khashoggi's killing.[16] He was then pardoned by Khashoggi's children on May 20, 2020.[17]

Jim Jordan’s wrestling double standard.,slate.com,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/07/jim-jordans-wrestling-double-standard.html,06-07-18 23:55,"Jim Jordan, a Republican congressman from Ohio, wants to be speaker of the House. But he has a problem. From 1986 to 1994, Jordan was the assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State University. Several men who wrestled for OSU during those years say Jordan knew that the team doctor, Richard Strauss, was molesting members of the team. Jordan says he knew nothing about it. He swears that if he’d known, he would have rushed to inform the authorities.
Accusations such as these can be hard to adjudicate. Even when those who are accused did know something, it’s sometimes difficult to decide how harshly to judge them. But in this case, it’s easy. Jordan has clarified the rules by which we should evaluate him. They’re the rules he applies in judging others:
1. You’re responsible for what happens on your watch. In 2013, Jordan berated then-FBI Director Robert Mueller for not knowing details about an FBI investigation of the IRS. Last fall, after Mueller took charge of the Russia investigation, Jordan suggested that Mueller was corrupt because he “was running the FBI when the whole Uranium One deal was going down.” At a hearing last week, Jordan accused Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein of redacting information from documents in order to deceive Congress. He also claimed that Rosenstein had told FBI agent Peter Strzok not to answer questions from Congress. Rosenstein explained that he’d given Strzok no such instructions, nor had he made the redactions. Jordan dismissed these excuses, reminding Rosenstein: “You’re the boss.”
2. You’re responsible for monitoring the people around you. Jordan suggests there’s something suspicious about the proximity of Rosenstein’s office to the office that was occupied, until late last year, by Bruce Ohr, a Department of Justice official connected to the Steele dossier. “Bruce Ohr, four doors down from Mr. Rosenstein … is meeting with the guy who wrote the dossier, meeting with Christopher Steele,” Jordan protested on the House floor in December. “Bruce Ohr … four doors down from Mr. Rosenstein, is also meeting with Glenn Simpson, the guy who founded Fusion GPS, the people who paid for the dossier.” Rosenstein wasn’t the deputy AG and didn’t work in the building when these events took place. But Jordan implicates him by association anyway.
3. It’s immoral to remain silent about the truth of an accusation. Last year, in order to “lift the cloud” of the Russia scandal, President Donald Trump repeatedly pressured then-FBI Director James Comey to declare that Trump wasn’t under investigation. Comey demurred, regarding such a statement as premature, unwise, and wrong. So Trump fired him. Jordan supports Trump’s decision and holds Comey at fault. By saying nothing, Jordan told his House colleagues in April, Comey unjustly “allow[ed] the perception to exist” that Trump was under investigation.
4. Any incomplete disclosure is malicious and corrupt. In October 2016, DOJ asked a court to authorize Russia-related surveillance of Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. Jordan calls this application dishonest, saying it failed to disclose that part of its evidence came from partisan opposition research. Reporters have consistently reminded Jordan that his claim isn’t true, because the application mentioned the partisan connection in a footnote. Jordan says that’s not good enough. “If you and I go to court,” he told his House colleagues, “we have got to tell the whole truth. They didn’t.”
5. Any delay in disclosure is deliberate concealment. At a June 19 hearing, DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz testified that an anti-Trump text message from Strzok, which Jordan suspected of being suppressed for months, hadn’t been discovered until May. Jordan called that an outrageous delay by Rosenstein: “He sat on it for a month.” Horowitz then explained that the text had been a needle in a haystack of 100,000 lines of text. He said the IG’s office hadn’t noticed it and flagged it to DOJ until June 8, six days before it was released in an IG report and 11 days before the hearing. That was still unacceptable, said Jordan, because Rosenstein had failed to release it “right away.”
6. The penalty for these offenses should be prosecution or termination. In an April 11 interview with Laura Ingraham, Jordan excoriated Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions for failing to answer congressional inquiries to his satisfaction. “If things don’t change dramatically—and I’m talking days, not weeks or months—if they don’t change dramatically, then impeachment and contempt, and resignation should all be on the table,” Jordan declared. When Ingraham asked Jordan to name his targets, he replied: “Jeff Sessions and Rod Rosenstein. They’re the guys that are supposed to be in charge.”
With these rules in mind, let’s consider the evidence in the wrestling case. In April, Jordan told the Columbus Dispatch that “no one reported any type of abuse” to him when he was at Ohio State. “I had not heard about any type of abuse at all,” he said. This week, he repeated his categorical denial: “I never knew about any type of abuse.” Referring to his former Ohio State colleagues, Jordan added: “I have talked to other coaches. They didn’t know of any abuse.”
Several former OSU wrestlers, however, say they have direct knowledge that Jordan was aware of Strauss’ misconduct. One ex-wrestler, Mike DiSabato, says he saw Jordan express amazement when Strauss went into the showers to ogle an athlete. A second, Dunyasha Yetts, says he and others repeatedly told Jordan about Strauss using injury exams as opportunities to grope wrestlers. A third, Shawn Dailey, says Jordan participated in conversations about Strauss’ abuse. A fourth, Mark Coleman, also says Jordan knew. All four men call Jordan a friend and a good guy. But they corroborate one another’s stories. Dailey confirms that in one case, Yetts complained to Jordan about Strauss trying to pull down his shorts in response to a thumb injury. Yetts, Dailey, and DiSabato recall Jordan saying, in this conversation or in other exchanges, that Strauss had better not touch Jordan. In a Politico report published late on Friday, a former OSU wrestler adds that he saw Jordan shout at voyeurs to get out of the sauna.
So there’s testimony from multiple eyewitnesses that Jordan’s claim of ignorance is false. But there’s also documentary evidence that he may have concealed explicit knowledge for the past four months. DiSabato says that in March, he told Jordan of his intention to expose Strauss’ abuse. In that conversation, DiSabato recalls, Jordan responded by saying something like “I just want to be left out of it” or “Please leave me out of it.” Essentially, says DiSabato, Jordan “asked me not to get him involved.”
Jordan admits that DiSabato talked to him around that time—“late March, early April, sometime in there.” According to Fox News, emails between the two men “date back to March” and were forwarded by Jordan to his own lawyer. So when Jordan told the Dispatch that he knew nothing about any abuse, it seems likely that he had already heard from DiSabato about it. (The Dispatch hasn’t reported exactly when in April Jordan gave this quote, but the quote was published on May 3.) On April 24, there’s a clear record of DiSabato requesting help: In an email to Jordan, he pleaded: “You have the platform to cut through the double talk, placation and finger pointing.” Still, Jordan appears to have done nothing.
In every way, Jordan’s conduct violates the standards he applies to Comey, Mueller, Rosenstein, and Sessions. He ducked responsibility for offenses that occurred when he was, in effect, the deputy director of the OSU wrestling program. He claims to have known nothing about Strauss’ locker-room behavior, even though Strauss’ locker was next to his. And for months, despite explicit reports from Strauss’ victims, Jordan has kept silent, asking them not to involve him in the story.
A merciful judge might rationalize Jordan’s behavior. Such a judge might speculate that Jordan didn’t understand the seriousness of what Strauss was doing, that Jordan didn’t think of it as abuse, that he forgot the details, or that his reasons for asking to be left out of the story are understandable. But Jordan has never shown that kind of mercy. He insists that such a person should be prosecuted, charged, or forced from office. That is the justice he must now face.",jim jordan,06-07-18 23:55,cecd3b4faa660ff84b922f262eac69fc1c6d553bec98eb282e9758873846f1f8,0.314847201,"[{'score': 0.5409144163131714, 'topic': 'misconduct'}, {'score': 0.4153954088687897, 'topic': 'money_laundering'}]","[{'sentiment': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.4014679491519928, 'name': 'Donald Trump', 'topic': 'misconduct'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.40196043252944946, 'name': 'Donald Trump', 'topic': 'cyber'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.360233873128891, 'name': 'Jim Jordan', 'topic': 'misconduct'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.5079757571220398, 'name': 'Carter Page', 'topic': 'cyber'}, {'sentiment': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.3742380142211914, 'name': 'Shawn Dailey', 'topic': 'misconduct'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.373399555683136, 'name': 'Laura Ingraham', 'topic': 'misconduct'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.4248127043247223, 'name': 'Richard Strauss', 'topic': 'misconduct'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.39557746052742004, 'name': 'April Jordan', 'topic': 'misconduct'}, {'sentiment': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.5041513442993164, 'name': 'Jeff Sessions', 'topic': 'misconduct'}, {'sentiment': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.4874083697795868, 'name': 'Rod Rosenstein', 'topic': 'misconduct'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.5615642666816711, 'name': 'Robert Mueller', 'topic': 'misconduct'}, {'sentiment': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.4283407926559448, 'name': 'Robert Mueller', 'topic': 'bribery'}, {'sentiment': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.4189824163913727, 'name': 'Dunyasha Yetts', 'topic': 'misconduct'}]","Jim Jordan, a Republican congressman from Ohio, wants to be speaker of the House.

Erdogan Plays Refugee Card as Criticism Mounts Over Turkey's Kurdish Offensive,www.voanews.com,https://www.voanews.com/europe/erdogan-plays-refugee-card-criticism-mounts-over-turkeys-kurdish-offensive,07-10-19 0:00,"ISTANBUL - Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is threatening to ""open the gates"" to millions of refugees to enter Europe as criticism grows over Turkey's ongoing military operation against a Syrian Kurdish militia.
""Hey, European Union! Pull yourself together,"" Erdogan said at a meeting of party supporters Thursday. ""I repeat it: If you try to describe our operation as an invasion, we will do what's easy for us: we will open the doors and send 3.6 million refugees to you,"" he added, to rapturous applause.
Erdogan's threat comes as the European Union and individual leaders in Europe are voicing criticism and calls for an end to Turkey's major military offensive against the YPG Kurdish militia.
Ankara launched the offensive Wednesday against the YPG, which it designates as a terrorist organization linked to Kurdish insurgents inside Turkey. The second day of fighting saw an intensification of airstrikes and artillery barrages against the militia.
Tens of thousands of people are reported to have already fled the fighting, with growing numbers of civilian casualties.
""Turkey is putting millions of people at humanitarian risk,"" French President Emmanuel Macron said Wednesday at a news conference.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker holds a news conference at the EU Commission headquarters ahead of an informal meeting of EU leaders, Brussels, Belgium, May 7, 2019.
Blunt message
Analysts suggest what provoked Erdogan's migrant threat to Europe, however, were comments by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. On Wednesday, he called the Turkish operation a ""catastrophe"" and sent a blunt message to the Turkish president.
""If the plan [in Syria] involves the creation of a so-called 'safe zone,' don't expect the EU to pay for any of it,"" Juncker said.
That threat, some analysts say, will start alarm bells ringing in Ankara.
Turkey's military operation is seeking to create what Erdogan has called a ""safe zone"" 30 kilometers deep into Syria.
Ankara plans to use the ""safe zone"" to resettle up to 2 million Syrian refugees currently living in Turkey. On Thursday, Erdogan declared that a million new homes would be built in the planned zone.
Turkish media reported last month the project would cost more than $20 billion. Ankara reportedly is looking to the EU to foot much of the bill.
FILE - In this June 14, 2015 file photo taken from the Turkish side of the border between Turkey and Syria, in Akcakale, Sanliurfa province, southeastern Turkey, thousands of Syrian refugees walk in order to cross into Turkey.
The project is seen as a political lifeline for Erdogan. ""For Turkey to send even 1 million refugees back will be a great success,"" said Huseyin Bagci, professor of international relations at Ankara's Middle East Technical University.
""In the sense of not keeping the refugees here and paying for them,"" he added, ""everyday tensions in the country are growing over the refugees.""
Erdogan asserts that hosting the 3.6 million Syrian refugees has cost nearly $40 billion. The massive construction program required to house the returning refugees in the proposed Syrian ""safe zone"" also would provide a significant boost to Turkey's floundering economy, which has been another headache for Erdogan.
Critics accuse Ankara of seeking to change the demographic makeup of the region, however, replacing Kurds with Sunni Arab Syrians, who are considered more loyal to Turkey.
""There is zero chance of the EU funding this project. No decent country can consider this proposal,"" political scientist Cengiz Aktar said. ""To expect the EU to support a project involving the changing of demographics is madness.""

Accusations against Syrian Kurds
Ankara counters, accusing the Syrian Kurdish militia of ousting the local Arab population in the region, insisting it is seeking to redress those changes.
Given the high stakes, Erdogan is using what is widely seen as his most potent leverage over Europe — the threat of a new refugee exodus. On Thursday, the Turkish president gave Europe a stark choice: face ""catastrophe"" if you do not ""fall into line"" with Turkey's plans.
In the past few months, there has been a surge in refugees entering the Greek Islands from nearby neighboring Turkey.
Several Greek refugee centers warned of being overwhelmed. The rise in refugees stirred memories of the massive exodus in 2015 from Turkey when nearly a million people entered Greece.
A 2016 migrant deal between Ankara and the EU markedly reduced the number of migrants, with Turkey becoming Europe's gatekeeper.
Some analysts question the power of Erdogan's refugee card over Europe, though, given that since 2016, migration routes from Greece to western Europe are now closed.
""I can see Greece being sunk by any new exodus,"" said Soli Ozel, international relations lecturer at Istanbul's Kadir Has University. ""But I don't see any refugees going to anywhere else from Greece. Therefore, this can turn out to be a bluff by Erdogan, something that will devastate Greece but not anybody else.""
The recent increase in migrants entering Greece from Turkey and threats by Erdogan to end the migrant deal prompted a flurry of European diplomats and ministers rushing to Ankara seeking to assuage Turkish government concerns.
""The primary concern of all European countries — from Spain to Portugal to Italy — they are all afraid of another wave of migrants to Europe. The European chemistry is completely destroyed over migration,"" Bagci said.
Analysts claim Ankara likely will be banking on such European migration fears in its efforts to get the EU to pay for its Syrian initiative.",cengiz şenses,07-10-19 0:00,a59570770d7c320e77e2006f766e4c808b1ee1bbf31c5627f3db2841eb5799b4,0.591113162,"[{'score': 0.4718224108219147, 'topic': 'cyber'}, {'score': 0.4455508589744568, 'topic': 'trafficking'}, {'score': 0.49018993973731995, 'topic': 'terrorism'}]","[{'sentiment': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.42801380157470703, 'name': 'Recep Tayyip Erdogan', 'topic': 'terrorism'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.526275634765625, 'name': 'Recep Tayyip Erdogan', 'topic': 'sanctions'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.4241924285888672, 'name': 'Recep Tayyip Erdogan', 'topic': 'cyber'}]","ISTANBUL - Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is threatening to ""open the gates"" to millions of refugees to enter Europe as criticism grows over Turkey's ongoing military operation against a Syrian Kurdish militia.

Bouthaina Shaaban,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouthaina_Shaaban,30-03-10 22:30,"Bouthaina Shaaban (Arabic: بثينة شعبان‎) (born 1953) is a Syrian politician and is currently the political and media adviser to the President of Syria. Shaaban served as the first Minister of Expatriates for the Syrian Arab Republic, between 2003 and 2008,[2] and has been described as the Syrian government's face to the outside world.[3]
Life and education [ edit ]
Born in Masudiyah, Homs and a member of the Syrian Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party since the age of 16, she was educated in Britain and obtained her Ph.D. in English literature from the University of Warwick.[4] She is married with two daughters and a son.[2]
Career [ edit ]
Shaaban worked first as an interpreter for the Syrian presidents Hafez al-Assad and Bashar al-Assad, his son.[3] Under Hafez she became an ""adviser to the Foreign Ministry,""[3] and in 2003 she was named Minister of Expatriates, ""a new post created to try to lure wealthy Syrian expatriates abroad — or at least their resources — back home.""[3] In 2008, she was appointed political and media adviser to president Bashar al-Assad. Between 1985 and 2003 she was also the professor of Romantic poetry at the English department of Damascus University.[2]
Shaaban was particularly visible in English-speaking media after the Valentine's Day 2005 assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri, when she participated in several television interviews and wrote several op-ed pieces attacking the United Nations probe into Syrian involvement in the murder and insisted that Israel and the United States were responsible for Hariri's assassination.[5] In August 2011, the US sanctioned Shaaban together with other five other Syrian officials.[6]
She is the author of Both Right and Left Handed: Arab Women Talk About Their Lives (1988).[citation needed] A book composed mostly of interviews with Syrian, Lebanese, Palestinian, and Algerian women, Shaaban invites them to talk openly about their lives and the roles of women in their societies, how they feel they've changed through different times of war and crisis, and what they think the future holds for Arab women.[citation needed]
Connections to Syrian leadership [ edit ]
Shaaban's rise within the Syrian government is speculated to be due to her close friendship with Bushra Al-Assad. Sometime in the late 1980s, Shaaban also introduced Bushra to her future husband Assef Shawkat.[7]
During the Syrian Civil War, Shaaban mentioned in January 2020 that the Syrian economy is ""50 times better than 2011"", despite the deterioration of the value of the Syrian pound against U.S. dollar.[8] Later on, she urged Syrians to withstand and be patient upon the implementation of the Caesar Act; meanwhile, one of her sons seemed to have a lavish life in the United States.[9][10]
Honors [ edit ]
In 2005, Shaaban was presented with ""the Most Distinguished Woman in a Governmental Position"" award by the Arab League.",Bouthaina Shaaban,30-03-10 22:30,f6f2f48dad3ef750b31592cd5fb09635999996a78828727954aa9752ceab01fa,0.740339517,"[{'score': 0.46990031003952026, 'topic': 'misconduct'}]","[{'sentiment': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.43857479095458984, 'name': 'Bouthaina Shaaban', 'topic': 'terrorism'}, {'sentiment': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.4116109013557434, 'name': 'Bouthaina Shaaban', 'topic': 'assets'}]",Bouthaina Shaaban (Arabic: بثينة شعبان‎) (born 1953) is a Syrian politician and is currently the political and media adviser to the President of Syria.,"[{'name': 'Bushra Al-Assad'}, {'name': 'Bouthaina Shaaban'}, {'name': 'Rafiq Hariri'}, {'name': 'Bashar al-Assad'}, {'name': 'بثينة'}, {'name': 'Assef'}, {'name': 'Valentine'}, {'name': 'Hafez al-Assad'}, {'org_name': 'the Arab League'}, {'org_name': 'the Syrian Regional Branch'}, {'org_name': 'United Nations'}, {'org_name': ""the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party""}, {'org_name': 'the University of Warwick.[4]'}, {'org_name': 'Shaaban'}]",

Pre-Trial Chamber I declines to confirm the charges against Callixte Mbarushimana and orders his release,reliefweb.int,https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/pre-trial-chamber-i-declines-confirm-charges-against-callixte,16-12-11 18:09,"ICC-CPI-20111216-PR757
Situation : Democratic Republic of the Congo Case: The Prosecutor v. Callixte Mbarushimana
Today, 16 December 2011, Pre-Trial Chamber I of the International Criminal Court (ICC) decided by Majority, the Presiding Judge Sanji M. Monageng dissenting, to decline to confirm the charges in the case of The Prosecutor v. Callixte Mbarushimana and to release Mr Mbarushimana from the custody of the Court, on the completion of the necessary arrangements.
The Majority of the Chamber, comprising Judge Sylvia Steiner and Judge Cuno Tarfusser, found that there was not sufficient evidence to establish substantial grounds to believe that Callixte Mbarushimana could be held criminally responsible, under article 25(3)(d) of the Rome Statute, for the eight counts of war crimes and five counts of crimes against humanity brought against him by the Prosecutor.
This decision does not preclude the Prosecutor from subsequently requesting the confirmation of the charges against Callixte Mbarushimana if such request is supported by additional evidence. Both the Prosecutor and the Defense may also appeal the decision declining to confirm the charges and the order for the release of Mr Mbarushimana.
Factual findings
On the basis of the evidence presented, the Chamber found that there are substantial grounds to believe that, from at least 20 January 2009 until at least 31 December 2009, an armed conflict not of an international character took place in the North and South Kivus, in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), between the forces of the Government of the DRC, supported at times by Rwandese forces (RDF) or the forces of the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo, on the one side, and at least one organised armed group, the Forces Démocratiques pour la Libération du Rwanda - Forces Combattantes Abacunguzi (FDLR), on the other.
The Chamber found substantial grounds to believe that FDLR troops committed several war crimes in different locations and at different times, particularly in Busurungi and surrounding villages in March 2009 (murder) as well as on or about 9 to 12 May 2009 (attacking civilians, murder, mutilation, rape, cruel treatment, destruction of property and pillaging); in Manje on or about 20 July 2009 (attacking civilians, murder, cruel treatment and destruction of property); in Malembe on or about 11 to 16 August 2009 (attacking civilians and destruction of property), and in Mianga on or about 12 April 2009 (attacking civilians, murder and destruction of property).
Although the Chamber found substantial grounds to believe that acts amounting to war crimes were perpetrated in five out of the twenty-five occasions identified by the Prosecutor, the Majority found that the evidence submitted was insufficient to be convinced of the existence of substantial grounds to believe that such acts were part of a course of conduct amounting to “an attack directed against the civilian population” pursuant to or in furtherance of an organisational policy to commit such attack, within the meaning of article 7 of the Rome Statute which defines crimes against humanity. Accordingly, the Majority found that there were not substantial grounds to believe that crimes against humanity were committed by the FDLR troops.
The Majority of the Chamber, with the Presiding Judge dissenting, further found that Callixte Mbarushimana did not provide any contribution to the commission of the alleged crimes, even less a “significant” one.
Background
The DRC ratified the Rome Statute, the founding instrument of the International Criminal Court, on 11 April 2002. On 3 March 2004, the Government of the DRC referred to the Court the situation (the events falling under the Court's jurisdiction) in its territory since the entry into force of the Rome Statute on 1 July 2002. After a preliminary examination, the Prosecutor initiated an investigation on 21 June 2004.
On 28 September 2010, Pre-Trial Chamber I issued a warrant of arrest under seal for Mr Mbarushimana. The warrant was unsealed on 11 October 2010. On 25 January 2011, the French authorities surrendered Mr Mbarushumana to the Court. He was then transferred to the Court’s Detention Centre in The Hague. In the Document Containing the Charges, the Prosecutor charged Mr Mbarushimana with five counts of crimes against humanity (murder, inhumane acts, rape, torture, and persecution) and eight counts of war crimes (attacking civilians, murder, mutilation, cruel treatment, rape, torture, destruction of property and pillaging). The Confirmation of Charges hearing was held from 16 to21 September 2011.
Besides Callixte Mbarushimana, three persons have been transferred to the Court with respect to the situation in the DRC: Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, Germain Katanga and Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui. A warrant of arrest has also been issued against a forth person, Bosco Ntaganda, but has yet to be executed.
Investigations are ongoing with respect to the situation in the DRC.

Investigative website Mediapart accused the 45-year-old of using his parliamentary allowance to pay part of his membership fees for the green party (EELV) in 2013 and 2014, and of claiming those payments against his income tax in 2015.
De Rugy said on his Facebook page he was quitting in order to pursue legal action against Médiapart.
""The attacks and media lynching against my family have led me to take the necessary step back today — something that everyone will understand,"" he wrote.
Previously, Médiapart claimed he hosted lavish social dinners, which included lobster and fine wines, paid for by the taxpayer, when he was parliament speaker, as well as carrying out expensive renovations on his official residence.
At the time, De Rugy published a written response on Facebook saying the “informal dinners” were linked to his job, and that he had used the events to engage with people from civil society to inform his “variety of public work” as parliament speaker. He said he was committed to “transparency” in political life.
De Rugy said on Tuesday he had filed a criminal complaint for defamation on Tuesday morning ""faced with the untruths of Médiapart"".
""The mobilisation required to defend myself means that I am not in a position to take on the mission entrusted to me by the President of the Republic and the Prime Minister calmly and effectively,"" he added.
""At this painful time, I remain proud of the actions undertaken with the support of the parliamentary majority to implement major transformations for climate, energy, water, the fight against waste and biodiversity,"" he said in the Facebook statement.

It said in a statement the sanctions targeted Muhammad al-Qatirji and his trucking company, which it said facilitated fuel trade between the Syrian government and Islamic State militants.
Qatirji has close relations with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government and has worked directly with Islamic State, which has been driven out of much of the Syrian territory it once controlled, to provide it oil products, the statement said.
Also targeted by sanctions was a fuel-procurement network that operates in Syria, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates to secure deliveries to Syria, the statement said.
“The United States will continue to target those who facilitate transactions with the murderous Assad regime and support ISIS,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said, referring to the militant group by an acronym.
The Syria-based Qatirji Company has also shipped weapons to Syria from Iraq, the statement said.
It said Abar Petroleum Service SAL, one of the entities involved in the multi-state fuel network, last year brokered shipments of petroleum products including gasoline, gasoil, and liquefied petroleum gas to Syria worth more than $30 million.
Other components of the network were Adnan Al-Ali, Sonex Investments Ltd, Nasco Polymers & Chemicals, and Fadi Nasser, the U.S. statement said.
“Lebanon-based Nasco Polymers and UAE-based Sonex Investments were designated for facilitating shipments to Syrian ports by serving as consignees and chartering the vessels,” it said.
Nasser, chairman of Nasco Polymers, has received millions of dollars for arranging delivery of thousands of tons of fuel to Syria, the statement said.
UAE-based International Pipeline Construction was subjected to sanctions for being owned or controlled by Hesco Engineering, which facilitates payments originating in Syria, it said.
The sanctions mean any property in the United States of those targeted will be blocked and Americans are prohibited from doing business with them.

Pseudonyms of Donald Trump,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonyms_of_Donald_Trump,20-07-16 23:05,"Use of pseudonyms by Donald Trump
President Trump making a phone call in 2017. He used pseudonyms during call-in interviews throughout the 1980s and 1990s.
Donald Trump, an American businessman, politician, and 45th president of the United States, has used several pseudonyms, including ""John Barron"" (or ""John Baron""), ""John Miller"" and ""David Dennison"". His practice of sometimes speaking to the media under the guise of a spokesperson has been described as ""an open secret"" at the Trump Organization and in New York media circles.[1] Some New York editors recalled that ""calls from Barron were at points so common that they became a recurring joke on the city desk.""[2] A writer for Fortune reported that Trump's father Fred Trump had used the pseudonym Mr. Green in business dealings.[3]
Trump used the pseudonym ""John Barron"" (sometimes ""John Baron"") throughout the 1980s, with its earliest known usage in 1980 and its last acknowledgment in 1990. According to The Washington Post, the name was a ""go-to alias when [Trump] was under scrutiny, in need of a tough front man or otherwise wanting to convey a message without attaching his own name to it.""[4] Barron would be introduced as a spokesperson for Trump.[5]
The pseudonym first appeared within a June 6, 1980 New York Times article about Trump's decision to destroy two controversial sculptures from the Bonwit Teller flagship store (now the site of Trump Tower) that he had promised to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. ""Barron"", describing himself as ""a Trump Organization vice president"", acted as the spokesperson for Trump for three days in that case.[6] Trump continued to pose as ""Barron"" on occasion for the rest of the decade. In 1983 ""Barron"" told the press that Trump had decided not to purchase the Cleveland Indians.[7]
In May 1984, ""Barron"" lied to then-Forbes reporter Jonathan Greenberg about Trump's wealth and assets to get Trump on the Forbes 400 list. ""Barron"" stated to Greenberg that ""[m]ost of the assets [of Donald’s father Fred Trump] have been consolidated to Mr. [Donald] Trump."" In April 2018, Greenberg retrieved and made public the original audio recordings of his exchange with ""Barron"", and stated that ""Trump, through this [Barron] sockpuppet, was telling me he owned 'in excess of 90 percent'"" of Fred Trump's assets. Ultimately, Greenberg included Trump at the end of the Forbes 400 list at $100 million, one fifth of the $500 million which ""Barron"" was claiming as Donald Trump's net worth. According to Greenberg, Donald Trump was only ever worth just under $5 million, which was 5% of the net worth which was attributed to him by Forbes at the time and only 1% of what ""Barron"" was claiming.[8] Greenberg has corrected the record by stating that, as revealed in court documents in proceedings years later, Donald Trump never owned any of Fred Trump's assets until 1999 after Fred's death, and even then, inheriting only his share of Fred's deceased estate, with Donald Trump's three siblings and some grandchildren beneficiaries inheriting their corresponding shares.
Also in 1984, ""Barron"" gave the press a positive spin on the 1984 collapse of a plan to build Trump Castle in New York.[9] In 1985, ""Barron"" urged fellow United States Football League team owners to partially reimburse Trump for a high-priced player.[10] In April 1985, ""John Baron, a vice president in the Trump Organization,"" announced to the press that the Trump Organization had signed an agreement to buy an unopened Hilton Hotel in Atlantic City.[11]
Trump stopped using the pseudonym after he was compelled to testify in court proceedings that “John Barron” was one of his pseudonyms. The Washington Post suggested that Trump might have used the pseudonym longer if not for the “lawsuit in which he testified, under oath in 1990, that 'I believe on occasion I used that name.'""[4]
In 1991, a reporter for People attempted to interview Trump about the end of his marriage to Ivana and his rumored association with other women. She was called back by a publicist who gave his name as ""John Miller"", who gave her a long interview about Trump's marital affairs (""He's a good guy, and he's not going to hurt anybody. . . . He treated his wife well and . . . he will treat Marla well.""), his attractiveness to women, and his wealth. The reporter thought at the time that ""Miller"" sounded remarkably like Trump, and played the tape to several people who knew Trump and agreed it was Trump.[12] She says Trump later told her it was a ""joke gone awry"".[2] Trump denied that he posed as John Miller to tell People, ""[Madonna] called and wanted to go out with him, that I can tell you.""[13]
In 2016, The Washington Post obtained a copy of the tape and reported that it was Trump using a pseudonym. Trump denied it, saying ""It was not me on the phone."" Later, when a reporter asked Trump if he had ever employed a spokesperson named John Miller, he hung up.[1]
A 1992 letter to New York Magazine signed by ""Carolin Gallego"" replied to an article by Julie Baumgold. The letter asserted that ""as his secretary"" she knew Trump to treat women with respect.[14] This letter resurfaced in a 2017 article in the Washingtonian which highlighted similarities between patterns of repetition in Trump's speech and the final line in the letter, which read: ""I do not believe any man in America gets more calls from women wanting to see him, meet him, or go out with him. The most beautiful women, the most successful women—all women love Donald Trump."" The Washingtonian was unable to find any record of a Carolin Gallego as secretary to Trump.[15]
The name ""David Dennison"" was used as a pseudonym for Trump by his personal lawyer Michael Cohen in a 2016 pre-election non-disclosure agreement with pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels (born Stephanie Gregory Clifford and identified in the document as Peggy Peterson) regarding her allegation that she and Trump had an extramarital affair in 2006.[16][17] Keith Davidson acted as Stormy Daniels’ legal representative in that agreement. A later legal representative of Daniels, Michael Avenatti, later claimed that Davidson was a double agent all along working for Trump and Cohen.[18]
The same pseudonyms were also later used in a similar 2016 pre-election agreement involving payment for the silence of Playboy Playmate model Shera Bechard about an alleged extramarital affair, with a consequent pregnancy and subsequent abortion, between ""Dennison"" and ""Peterson"". That agreement was also drafted by Trump's personal lawyer Cohen, while Bechard was also represented by the same Keith Davidson who had negotiated Stormy Daniels’ agreement with Trump.[19]
In Bechard's case, sources identified ""Dennison"" as Republican fundraiser Elliott Broidy, who then acknowledged in an ambiguously worded statement that he had a “relationship” (the nature of which was not specified) and that he made the $1.6 million payment to her after being made aware of her pregnancy.[20] The phrasing of his statement also omitted any assertion that he was in fact the father of the unborn child. Some legal scholars and columnists have since speculated that Donald Trump was really the person who had the affair with Bechard.[21][22][23]
In popular culture [ edit ]
Cartoonist Ruben Bolling occasionally satirizes Trump's use of John Barron in comics titled Donald and John: A Boy and His Imaginary Publicist. It is drawn as a homage to the comic strip Calvin and Hobbes, about a boy with a rich fantasy life.[24][25]
In season 3, episode 5 of The Good Fight that airs on CBS All Access a character places a fake call to The Wall Street Journal using the name John Barron. This is followed by a musical interlude written by Jonathan Coulton and animated by Steve Angel explaining Trump’s use of the alias.[26]
In Don Winslow's 2019 novel The Border, the Trump-like president is named ""John Dennison"".[27]

GUANTÁNAMO BAY, Cuba — A judge has ruled against an Iraqi man held at Guantánamo Bay who wanted a federal court to intervene to improve his medical care and was seeking the appointment of an independent civilian doctor to oversee his treatment.
Lawyers for the prisoner, known as Abd al Hadi al Iraqi, 58, had filed the medical negligence case in 2017 after he underwent five spinal surgeries in nine months. Mr. Hadi is scheduled to go on trial in September on war crimes charges stemming from his alleged role as a commander of Taliban and Qaeda forces in Afghanistan.

US sanctions al-Qaida supporters,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/5ba690d5caea4e209e704f75a5474998,26-07-20 0:00,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. on Wednesday imposed sanctions on two al-Qaida supporters and added militants to its lists of terrorists.
The Treasury Department sanctioned Abd al-Rahman bin Umayr Nuaymi in Qatar and Abd al-Wahhab Muhammad Abd al-Rahman Humayqani in Yemen by naming them as specially designated global terrorists.
Nuaymi is a suspected terrorist financier and facilitator who allegedly has provided money and support and conveyed communications to al-Qaida and its affiliates in Syria, Iraq, Somalia and Yemen for more than a decade. Humayqani allegedly used his position as head of a Yemen-based charity to raise money, including funds sent to the group al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. He also is accused of facilitating financial transfers from al-Qaida supporters in Saudi Arabia to Yemen.

Also designated was the militant group called al-Mulathamun Battalion, which became a separate organization in late 2012 after its leader split with al-Qaida. A team of fighters within the battalion claimed responsibility for the January attack against a natural gas facility in Algeria.

Dragoljub Kunarac,trialinternational.org,https://trialinternational.org/latest-post/dragoljub-kunarac/,26-07-20 0:00,"Trial Watch would like to remind its users that any person charged by national or international authorities is presumed innocent until proven guilty.
facts
Dragoljub Kunarac was born on 15 May 1960 in Foca (Bosnia-Herzegovina).
From April 1992 until at least February 1993, the Foca region was the scene of a conflict which opposed the Serbs and Muslims of Bosnia. The Serb military forces had entirely occupied the town of Foca (south-east of Sarejevo) and the surrounding villages. This area continued to be under siege until mid-July 1992.
Dragoljub Kunarac was at the head of a special unit for reconnaissance which was part of the Foca tactical group of the Bosnian Serb camp. He was a well informed soldier, having access to the highest ranks of the military command in the zone and was in charge of gathering information about the enemy. He was found guilty of the rape of several Muslim women, of inciting his soldiers to commit collective rape, and of forcing women into slavery. He was thereby judged to be guilty of crimes against humanity (torture, enslavement and rape), and of violations of the laws and customs of war (torture and rape).
Soon after the Serb forces seized Foca, they began to arrest its Muslim and Croatian inhabitants. The Serb authorities then reportedly separated the men from the women and illegally detained thousands of Muslims and Croatians in several long or short term detention centres, or assigned them to house arrest. During these arrests, several civilians were killed, beaten or subjected to sexual violence.
Dragoljub Kunarac was cited in the indictment as being the commander of a special reconnaissance unit of the Bosnian Serb Army from June 1992 until at least February 1993.
In his capacity as commander of these soldiers, Dragoljub Kunarac was responsible for the acts of the soldiers subordinate to him and knew or had reason to know that his subordinates sexually assaulted Muslim women. He was personally said to have been involved in sexual assaults and rape of women.
Kunarac gave himself up voluntarily on 4 March 1998, and was handed over to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) the following day.
legal procedure
Kunarac gave himself up voluntarily on 4 March 1998, and was handed over to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) the following day.
At his first court appearance, he pleaded not guilty to all of the counts with which he was charged.
Dragoljub Kunarac was indicted on the basis of his individual criminal responsibility (Art.7 (1) ICTY Statute) and/or alternatively on the basis of his responsibility as hierarchical superior (Art. 7 (3) ICTY Statute) for:
– crimes against humanity (Art. 5 ICTY Statute: torture, rape and enslavement);
– violations of the laws and customs of war (Art. 3 ICTY Statute: rape, outrages upon personal dignity, plunder of private property and torture).
His trial, which was heard at the same time as that of Radomir Kovac and Zoran Vukovic, (see “related cases”), opened on 20 March 2000.
On 22 February 2001, the First Trial Chamber of the ICTY sentenced Dragoljub Kunarac to 28 years in prison, judging him to be guilty of torture, rape and enslavement as crimes against humanity and/or as violations of the laws and customs of war.
On 12 June 2002, the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY confirmed the sentence of 28 years imprisonment.
Dragoljub was transferred to Germany on 12 December 2002 to serve out the remainder of his sentence.
spotlight
The decision of 22 February 2001 became the first case in which the ICTY handed down a sentence for rape as a crime against humanity.
It was also the first case at the ICTY for which sentences were pronounced for enslavement as a crime against humanity.
In the decision, the Appeals Chamber also defined torture and stated that it did not have to be the fact of a person acting in an official capacity to qualify as torture:
– “The definition of torture has the following elements:
“(i) The infliction, by act or omission, of severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental. (ii) The act or omission must be intentional. (iii) The act or omission must aim at obtaining information or a confession, or at punishing, intimidating or coercing the victim or a third person, or at discriminating, on any ground, against the victim or a third person.” (Kunarac, Kovac and Vukovic, Appeals Chamber, 12 June 2002, §. 142)
– “[T]he public official requirement is not a requirement under customary international law in relation to the criminal responsibility of an individual for torture outside of the framework of the Torture Convention.” (Kunarac, Kovac and Vukovic, Appeals Chamber, 12 June 2002, §. 148)
context
INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR FORMER YUGOSLAVIA
The conflict in former Yugoslavia from 1991 to 1999, shocked international public opinion because of the abuses revealed by the press, which were committed by all parties to the conflict (massacres, forced displacements of population, concentration camps …). The conflict is considered to consist of several separate conflicts, which were ethnic in nature – the war in Slovenia (1991), the war in Croatia (1991-1995), the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina (1992-1995) and the war Kosovo (1998-1999), which also involved the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999.
The conflicts accompanied the break-up of Yugoslavia, when the constituent republics declared their independence. The wars mostly ended after peace accords were signed, and new republics were given full international recognition of their statehood.
In order to restore peace and security in the region, the Security Council acting under Chapter VII of UN Charter, created on 25 May 1993, by Resolution 827, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). It was determined that pursuant to numerous reports of, among other, mass killings, systematic detention, rapes, practice of “ethnic cleansing”, transfers, etc., these acts constituted a threat to international peace and security, necessitating a reaction by Security Council. As the Tribunal was created during the ongoing conflict, the Security Council expressed its hopes that ICTY would contribute to halting violations in the region. Its headquarters are in The Hague, Netherlands.
The Tribunal has jurisdiction to prosecute persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law – grave breaches of Geneva Conventions, violations of laws and customs of war, genocide and crimes against humanity – allegedly committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia after 1 January 1991, (no end date was specified). Since its creation, the ICTY has indicted more than 160 people, including heads of states and government members.
The Tribunal’s mandate was originally meant to expire on 31 December 2009, but the Security Council voted unanimously to extend the mandate of the Court with several judges, including permanent judges, so that the ongoing trials can be completed. According to the “ICTY Completion Strategy Report” from 18 May 2011, all trials were supposed to be completed by the end of 2012, and all the appeals by the end of 2015. The exceptions were cases of Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic.
The Security Council adopted resolution 1966 on 22 December 2010, establishing International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals. The ICTY residual mechanism began functioning on 1 July 2013.
The Tribunal was called to finish its work by the end of 2014, in order to prepare closure and transfer of cases to the Residual Mechanism. The Mechanism is a small and temporary body, which plays important role in ensuring that the completion strategy of ICTY does not result in impunity of fugitives and in injustice. It is conducting all outstanding first instance trials, including those of Karadzic, Mladic and Hadzic. It is also to complete all appeals proceedings that were filed before 1 July 2013.
The ICTY is not the only court with jurisdiction to try alleged perpetrators of serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the former Yugoslavia. The Tribunal has concurrent jurisdiction with national courts. However, it takes precedence over them and may require the referral from the national court at any stage of the proceedings (Article 9 of the ICTY Statute). The Statute does not elaborate how the primacy is to be exercised, but it was asserted by the judges of the ICTY in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. The primacy can be asserted in three cases: when an international crime is intentionally or unwittingly prosecuted before national court as an “ordinary criminal offence”, when a national court is unreliable, or when the case is closely related, or may be relevant to other cases being tried by the ICTY.
NATIONAL JURISDICTIONS
National courts also have jurisdiction to prosecute alleged perpetrators of serious violations of international humanitarian law.
In the former Yugoslavia, the trials of those accused of war crimes have been opened by the courts of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Section for War Crimes was set up in the Criminal and Appellate Divisions of the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Special Chamber for War Crimes has jurisdiction to prosecute the most serious alleged war crimes committed in Bosnia, and was created to relieve the ICTY, so that it can focus on criminals of high rank. Its establishment was also considered necessary for effective war crimes prosecution in Bosnia. The opening of the Special Chamber was on 9 March 2005.
Additionally, pursuant to UN Security Council Resolution 1244 from 10 June 1999, UN administration was created in Kosovo. Consequently, in 2000 “Regulation 64” Panels in Courts of Kosovo were created, which are mixed chambers at the local courts. They have two international judges and one national. These panels work in collaboration with the ICTY. They have jurisdiction over those responsible for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. They focus on prosecuting lower ranking offenders.
In Serbia, the Office of the War Crimes Prosecutor was established on 1 July 2003. It was created to detect and prosecute perpetrators of criminal offenses against humanity and international law, and offences recognised by the ICTY Statute, regardless of the nationality, citizenship, race or religion of the perpetrator and the victim, as long as the acts were committed on the territory of former Yugoslavia after 1 January 1991. Its seat is in Belgrade, Serbia.
Other relevant national jurisdictions are under the principle of universal jurisdiction, which allows states with a specific legal basis, to try perpetrators of serious crimes regardless of their nationality or that of the victims and regardless of where the crime was committed.",dragoljub kunarac,26-07-20 0:00,8965939f059aa99e3cc044827503c0437f0f18cf0bcf9fdfb9846b94acb8c21f,0.665748474,"[{'score': 0.4394095242023468, 'topic': 'embezzlement'}, {'score': 1.0, 'topic': 'crime'}, {'score': 0.5872277021408081, 'topic': 'misconduct'}, {'score': 0.406046599149704, 'topic': 'tax_evasion'}, {'score': 0.4645466208457947, 'topic': 'money_laundering'}, {'score': 0.40405604243278503, 'topic': 'identity_theft'}, {'score': 0.4674926996231079, 'topic': 'cyber'}, {'score': 0.4355410635471344, 'topic': 'terrorism'}, {'score': 0.4111303389072418, 'topic': 'bribery'}]","[{'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.4952244460582733, 'name': 'Dragoljub Kunarac', 'topic': 'embezzlement'}, {'sentiment': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.3541492819786072, 'name': 'Dragoljub Kunarac', 'topic': 'tax_evasion'}, {'sentiment': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.3729844391345978, 'name': 'Dragoljub Kunarac', 'topic': 'money_laundering'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.46596166491508484, 'name': 'Dragoljub Kunarac', 'topic': 'bribery'}]","Trial Watch would like to remind its users that any person charged by national or international authorities is presumed innocent until proven guilty.

Garry Breitkreuz,openparliament.ca,https://openparliament.ca/politicians/garry-breitkreuz/,26-07-20 0:00,"Common Sense Firearms Licensing Act May 29th, 2015
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to debate Bill C-42, the common sense firearms licensing act, which is in fact what it is.
This is a bill that is very important to my constituents and to the law-abiding firearms community across Canada. It is also a bill that is very important to me personally.
As members know, I will not be running again in the next election. As members also know, changes to our firearms laws to make them safe and sensible has been something I have worked on very hard during the time I have been in this place. I introduced almost half a dozen private member's bills to reduce needless red tape that had been heaped upon law-abiding gun owners over the years. I am pleased that many of the measures I have advocated for over the years have made their way into legislation introduced by ministers in our Conservative government.
Canadians are interested in the facts of what this common sense firearms licencing act will do and will not do.
This important point is something the NDP and Liberals seem to forget. This bill will make participation in the classroom component of the firearms safety training course mandatory, for the first time, for firearms owners. It will ensure that all those who join the rapidly growing ranks of the 2.2 million licensed firearms owners will have a common understanding of how to safely operate firearms.
What the bill will not do is allow “duck hunting with a machine gun capable of bringing down a MiG”. This is the shocking misinformation suggested by the NDP member for Marc-Aurèle-Fortin.
What the bill will do is end needless paperwork for the authorization to transport restricted and prohibited firearms. This paperwork was not shared with law enforcement, or anyone for that matter. It was simply filed away in a drawer, never to be thought about again.
What the bill will not do, as the Liberal leader suggested, is “allow handguns and assault weapons to be freely transported in a trunk anywhere within a province, even left parked outside a Canadian Tire or a local hockey arena”. Members do not need to believe me. The non-partisan assistant deputy minister of Public Safety was asked about these comments and whether they were accurate. Her answer was simple and straightforward. She said, “no”.
I think the Liberal leader is cynically trying to scare Canadians, or he simply has no understanding of how firearms laws work in Canada. Either way, it is just another example that he is just not up to the job of leading.
The common sense firearms licensing act will also establish a six-month grace period for firearms owners so that they do not become criminals overnight when their licence expires. I was listening to the debate previously, and it was said that we get a notice for every other licence. However, we do not become criminals if we neglect to renew our driver's licence. It is very different with a firearms licence.
The NDP member for Newton—North Delta said:
For a gun owner it would still be perfectly okay for six months after one's licence expires. That would be legalized in this legislation. When my driver's licence expires, it expires on that date and I have to get it renewed beforehand.
While that is a correct statement, what she forgets is that if I forget to renew my driver's licence, I face about a $200 fine. If I forget to renew my firearms licence, I face many years in prison. It simply does not make sense. We need common sense, and that is what this bill is all about.
This bill will also merge the possession-only licence and the possession-and-acquisition licence. This technical-sounding change can be broken down very simply.
Approximately 600,000 experienced firearms owners did not want to comply with the Liberal firearms regime back in 1995. They did not want to jump through hoops, as they had owned guns for some time. Therefore, this category was created, but they were not allowed to buy new firearms.
This group averages about 60 years of age. They have all had their firearms in excess of 20 years. They are well trained in how to safely use firearms. Therefore, this change will be good for the economy, as this large group of people will be able to purchase firearms.
Let us listen to what Pierre Latraverse, of the Quebec hunters and anglers federation, had to say about this measure. He said:
It's a very positive measure, given that there will only be a single licence under these conditions. This is much more representative of what owning a firearm is like. Currently, there are two licences: a possession licence and a possession and acquisition licence. If you only have a possession licence, you cannot purchase firearms. You have to go through the system to buy a possession and acquisition licence. With the merger, a hunter won't have to go through the whole administrative process again to purchase another firearm.
The common sense firearms licensing act will also restrict the ability of chief firearms officers to make arbitrary decisions. Currently, section 58 of the Firearms Act gives authority to unelected bureaucrats that I do not believe exists anywhere else in law. Let me read this section. It says:
A chief firearms officer who issues a licence, an authorization to carry or an authorization to transport may attach any reasonable condition to it that the chief firearms officer considers desirable in the particular circumstances and in the interests of the safety of the holder or any other person.
Tony Bernardo, the executive director of the Canadian Shooting Sports Association, rightly describe this section as creating “God powers” for the CFO. We will return elected officials to their rightful place as the overseers of bureaucrats.
I have talked a lot about measures that will reduce red tape. I would also like to talk about a measure that I find very important in the common sense firearms licencing act. That is the strengthening of firearms prohibition orders for those who have been convicted of domestic violence offences.
We believe that past behaviour is a good indicator of future results. Clearly, someone who has a serious conviction for domestic violence is volatile. We do not believe that firearms ought to be present in those types of situations.
The last measure in the bill I would like to touch on is the ability of elected officials to overturn decisions of the Canadian firearms program regarding classification. We all recall the decision of the Canadian firearms programs to attempt to ban two firearms that had been sold in Canada for well over a decade. In fact, by the stroke of a bureaucrat's pen, thousands of Canadians were turned into criminals overnight, probably without their knowledge. This was without consulting the Minister of Public Safety or his staff, without consulting the public safety committee, and without consulting anyone.
It is clear that this is unacceptable. That is why we are creating this measure. It is why, as soon the bill receives royal assent, we will move to restore the classification of the Swiss Arms family of rifles and the CZ858 to its previous non-restricted status.
As many of my colleagues have said through the course of this debate, it is about culture. There are 2.2 million Canadians who are licensed firearms owners, many in Toronto, despite what some people here think, and an estimated four million Canadians, partake in hunting, fishing, trapping, or sport shooting. I will repeat that: four million Canadians participate in these things.
Why is that? It is because these activities are part of our shared Canadian heritage.",garry breitkreuz,26-07-20 0:00,1120bcf511ee0351e0171a45c447dfed16a384bdb86d9ece5d2dd1fe769e158a,0.172176309,"[{'score': 0.4058564603328705, 'topic': 'assets'}, {'score': 0.4453953206539154, 'topic': 'corruption'}]","[{'sentiment': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.42938685417175293, 'name': 'Bill C-42', 'topic': 'crime'}, {'sentiment': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.3750792443752289, 'name': 'Bill C-42', 'topic': 'assets'}]","Common Sense Firearms Licensing Act May 29th, 2015

Tobacco Production in Myanmar to Go up 27pc in 2014-15FY,mmbiztoday.com,https://mmbiztoday.com/tobacco-production-in-myanmar-to-go-up-27pc-in-2014-15fy/,12-08-14 12:00,"Tobacco companies have paid taxes in advance for the production of an additional 27.4 million packs of cigarettes for the 2014-15 fiscal year, according to the Internal Revenue Deparment (IRD).
The total declared amount of cigarette packs to be produced in the current fiscal year now stands at 461.8 million packs, up 27 percent compared to 2013-14FY.
The IRD collected K30.96 billion ($31.91 million) in taxes for the 362.5 million packs produced in 2013-14FY.
Four cigarette factories were inspected in June at the instruction of the Tax Regulation Board to confirm the number of tax stamps bought matched the actual number of packs being produced. The inspections found the factories to be in compliance, officials said.
Cigarette companies operating in Myanmar have been increasingly bold in their marketing campaigns, activists and regulating officials said.
The 2006 Cigarettes and Tobacco Products Law had helped reduce intense marketing of products in the years following its enactment. However, since 2010 marketing campaigns have rebounded and an increasing number of new cigarette brands are entering the market.
Marketing campaigns are more visible in rural areas, with sale booths and advertisements materials being set up at traditional ethnic festivals, activists said.
“No one has been penalised in accordance with the cigarette and tobacco law. This demonstrates the government’s failure to enforce the law to its full extent,” said Dr Nyo Nyo Thin, a member of the parliament.
Major international cigarette companies have expanded into Myanmar due to the country’s low tax rate and also relatively weak legislation on tobacco products compared with neighbouring countries, said U Ye Tun, another member of the parliament. Myanmar currently imposes 50 percent tax on tobacco products.
Cigarette and cheroot has been widely produced in Myanmar for a long time, and being a labour-intensive industry it has been difficult to uproot, industry insiders say.
The practice of prepaying for tax stamps is not uncommon among cigarette companies in Myanmar.

"Iraq Report: April 26, 2002",www.rferl.org,https://www.rferl.org/a/1343162.html,26-04-02 0:00,"IRAQI GOVERNMENT PREPARING FOR WAR. Several recent reports from Iraq indicate that Iraqi President Saddam Husseyn believes war is imminent. Husseyn met with Minister of Military Industrialization Abd al-Tawab Mullah al-Huwaysh on 20 April, according to the Iraqi News Agency (INA) on 20 and 21 April. Ministry employees told Husseyn that they were working ""to consolidate technical capabilities for the people to confront the aggressors' threats, foil their evil scheming and thwart their unjust sanctions."" Husseyn praised the ministry employees for ""their great enthusiasm to serve the people of lofty Iraq and enhance their ability to remain steadfast in the face of criminal invaders.""
This was the second recent meeting between Husseyn and Huwaysh reported by Iraq's state-controlled media. On 15 April, Republic of Iraq Television reported that Husseyn had met Huwaysh. ""Minister Huwaysh besought Almighty God to grant the president a long life, continued good health, and loftiness, protect him, and guide his steps,"" the report said. Huwaysh also ""besought Almighty God to enable him and his comrades to be part of the Iraqi armies under the president's wise leadership to liberate the land of Palestine and its crown, holy Jerusalem, from the criminal Zionists.""
The Iraqi government has placed anti-aircraft guns ""over most of Baghdad's high-rises including buildings housing the ministries of Foreign Affairs, Interior, Planning, and state-run radio and television,"" the 17 April ""Iraq Press"" reported. In addition, there are new missile batteries and gun emplacements at the al-Daura oil refinery in Baghdad, and the Zaafaraniya industrial complex, the article said. Recent reports say that the Iraqi government had deployed tank units in its northern and southern oil fields (See ""RFE/RL Iraq Report,"" 19 April 2002). On 22 April, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman General Richard Myers said that Iraq has deployed surface-to-air missile batteries in the Iraqi ""no-fly"" zones, reported AP later that same day. Husseyn also is seeking to protect his personal property from attack. According to the 21 April ""Iraq Press,"" he has dispersed his fleet of luxury vehicles. (Michael Rubin).
BAGHDAD ACCELERATES APARTHEID, ETHNIC CLEANSING. The Iraqi government's ethnic-cleansing campaign against the country's non-Arab citizens has accelerated, according to the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) Kurdish-language daily ""Kurdistan Nuwe"" on 17 April. ""Daily, the Iraqi government further intensifies the policy of ethnic cleansing and deportation of Kurds in the regions under its own control,"" reported ""Kurdistan Nuwe."" The article continues, ""Whenever the global problems become more intricate and more threatening, the Iraqi government finds it an opportune time to further implement its schemes against the Iraqi people in general and the Kurdish people in particular.""
The same article said that the Iraqi government had recently begun construction of 200 houses to be reserved for Arab families transported from southern Iraq. ""On 5 January 2002, [Saddam Husseyn's] Presidency Council issued a directive through the Interior Ministry, to the Kirkuk Governorate in which it called for probing into the causes of death of all the Kurdish citizens from 1991 to 1996 in Kirkuk, for the purpose of expelling...the families and relatives of the Kurds who were martyred in the battles for liberating Kirkuk...,"" the report said. The battles for liberating Kirkuk refer to the brief seizure of Kirkuk by Iraqi Kurdish forces during the abortive March 1991 Kurdish uprising.
Since the beginning of this year, ""Kurdistan Nuwe"" reported, the Iraqi government has ""decided to allocate vast areas of land"" to Arabs exclusively. This land includes plots in between the Zewiya and Azadi districts, around the football stadium in Azadi, and between the Iskan and Karama districts. Land behind the Pepsi Cola plant in Rahim Awa is now allocated only ""to the Arab [Ba'th] party comrades."" Numerous Arab families have been relocated to the surrounding villages of Hafta Chashma, Omara Gada, and Qara Ways, the report said. The Regional Secretariat of the Ba'th Party has further ordered that ethnic Kurds may not purchase contracts for shops and businesses.
There are also reports in the Kurdistan Democratic Party's (KDP) press concerning the Iraqi government's continuing ethnic-cleansing campaign. The 19 April issue of the KDP Arabic-language daily ""Khabat"" reported: ""Within the framework of the continuing Arabization policies implemented by the central [Iraqi] authorities in Kirkuk...the authorities decided to auction some of the government-owned houses in Kirkuk. Instructions allow only Arabs to buy these houses, preventing the indigenous Kurdish, Turkoman, and Assyrian inhabitants from doing so."" The article continued, ""Observers say that the city's Kurdish, Turkoman and Assyrian inhabitants are considered second-class citizens and are deprived of any legal or constitutional rights."" Thousands of Kurdish and some Turkoman Iraqis expelled from Kirkuk, Khanaqin, and Sinjar live in tent cities near Chamchamal, or in temporary housing in Kifri and Kalar, as well as in abandoned Iraqi military facilities in Irbil and Sulaymaniyah. Iraq is one of the most ethnically diverse countries in the Arab world. There has been no widely accepted census in almost 50 years, but most estimates place the non-Arab population of Iraq at between 25 and 30 percent of the country. (Michael Rubin)
NEW POTENTIAL FOR IRAQI BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH. UN Special Commission (UNSCOM) Chairman Richard Butler reported in an 18 March 1999 letter to the UN Security Council about inspections of a facility in Daura, Iraq, ""Research was also undertaken on viral agents for Iraq's biological warfare program, including camelpox, enterovirus 70 and rotavirus."" Iraq had diverted equipment for the production of foot-and-mouth disease vaccine for use in biological weapons production at Daura.
According to the May 2002 issue of the ""Journal of General Virology,"" the camelpox virus and the variola virus that causes smallpox in humans ""are much more closely related to each other than to any other virus."" The article notes that although ""the disease smallpox has been eradicated,"" the variola or similar viruses might be used in bioterrorism. Authors Caroline Gubser and Geoffrey Smith note that camelpox has never caused disease in man, but they warn that the eradication of smallpox and the resulting ""immunological naivete"" of much of the world's population, makes the camelpox threat much more serious.
Smith elaborated on the report's findings in a 17 April interview with NewScientist.com. According to Smith, ""It was surprising how close these two viruses were.... It could be that only a small set of changes would be necessary for camelpox virus to infect people."" (Michael Rubin).
IRAQI GOVERNMENT ACCELERATES AID TO PALESTINIANS... Baghdad will extend more aid to the Palestinian groups in the West Bank and Gaza, Iraqi TV reported on 21 April. ""His excellency mujahid leader, President Saddam Husseyn, may God protect him, has chaired the cabinet's 17th session,"" according to the report. ""The cabinet reviewed...current developments in Palestine. It also discussed the ugly, racist, bloody, and criminal Zionist scheme currently being implemented in Palestine,"" the report said. ""The president, may God grant him victory, ordered that $25,000 shall be allocated to every house in Jenin that was destroyed by criminal Zionists."" Husseyn also recently said that the Iraqi government would pay families of suicide bombers $25,000 (see ""RFE/RL Iraq Report,"" 12 April 2002).
The Iraqi government is transferring aid beyond the rewards for suicide bombers and money for those whose houses were destroyed in the recent battle between Israeli Defense Forces and gunmen from the Palestinian Authority, Hamas, and Palestine Islamic Jihad. The Iraqi News Agency reported on 18 April that ""upon instruction from Leader President Saddam Husseyn, the third batch of the Iraqi steadfastness convoy set out on its journey in support of our people in Palestine."" Iraqi Trade Minister Muhammad Mahdi Salih said that the supply convoy was to help the Palestinians ""regain their usurped rights and expel the Zionist entity."" He further condemned ""the U.S. administration of evil, the sponsor of terrorism.""
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz offered ""beloved Palestine"" his moral support in a speech broadcast on 14 April on Republic of Iraq Television. Aziz said: ""Zionism is not only a terrorist movement, but also an imperialist one. Its usurper and occupier entity in Palestine is a criminal imperialist entity that is absolutely allied with U.S. imperialism and serves its aims in the Arab homeland."" Aziz received on 17 April a delegation from the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), Republic of Iraq Television reported. Their talks ""dealt with latest developments of the Palestinian intifada, its continuation, and escalation of its struggle march to defeat the occupation forces and the Zionist-imperialist aggression,"" according to Iraqi television. The DFLP split from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in 1969, and according to its charter, Palestinian goals can only be achieved through popular revolution of the working class. In spite of its concern about the working class, the DFLP killed seven Bangladeshi workers in March 1996 when it burned down a restaurant in Sitrah, Bahrain, according to the International Policy Institute for Counter-Terrorism. (Michael Rubin).
KUWAIT DUBIOUS OF IRAQI COMMITMENTS. Kuwaiti Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Shaykh Muhammad Sabah al-Salim al-Sabah remains doubtful that Iraq's high-profile commitments at the 27-28 March Arab League summit were anything more than rhetoric, KUNA reported on 18 April (see ""RFE/RL Iraq Report,"" 5 April 2002). Shaykh Muhammad told the Lebanese ""Al-Sayyad"" magazine, ""We want to make sure that Iraq's stance towards Kuwait had radically changed and is not just a temporary speech."" Shaykh Muhammad credited U.S. policy for the Iraqi government's new willingness to accept Kuwait's right to exist. ""We saw the difference of the Iraqi speech addressed in the Arab summit held in Beirut, which came after the U.S. threats,"" he said. Shaykh Muhammad expressed frustration with Iraqi noncompliance with UN Security Council resolutions. ""We do not have impossible demands for Iraq to carry out.... We want Iraq to release our POWs and that it promises that it would not repeat its aggression of Kuwait...."" On 18 April, the UN Security Council also called on Iraq to make good on pledges made at the Arab League summit, a UN Wire report of the same date said. (Michael Rubin)
...AND KILLS THOSE WHO DO NOT VOLUNTEER. The 19 April issue of ""Khabat"" reported that, 10 days earlier, Iraqi security forces executed a young Kurdish man in the Iskan quarter of Kirkuk after he refused to join the voluntary al-Quds army, which Saddam Husseyn formed to liberate Palestine. (Michael Rubin)
BAGHDAD REAFFIRMS SUPPORT FOR SUICIDE BOMBERS. Saddam Husseyn reaffirmed his support for suicide bombers in a 15 April speech aired on Republic of Iraq Television. ""May God have mercy upon our martyrs, chief among whom are the perpetrators of the martyrdom operations."" Husseyn disagreed with the label suicide bombers. ""These are not suicide operations...because the Palestinians do not kill themselves out of despair,"" Husseyn said. The next day, Shaykh 'Abd al-Ghafur al-Qaysi elaborated on Husseyn's logic. Speaking on Republic of Iraq Television, al-Qaysi said: ""The difference between martyrdom and suicide is that suicide is killing oneself out of fear, and takes place in a moment of weakness and to evade the burdens of life. As for martyrdom operations, they are carried out to uphold God's word."" Al-Qaysi continued to relate a ruling from ""the men of religion in Iraq,"" which said, ""Martyrdom operations by the sons of our Palestinian people against the odious Zionist occupation are the highest form of jihad from a religious point of view and are carried out for the sake of God."" (Michael Rubin)
IRAQ BOOSTS ARAB TRADE. The Iraqi government has had considerable recent success in bolstering trade with the Arab world, despite continued UN sanctions. The fourth week-long Egyptian products fair opened on 18 April, inaugurated by Iraqi Vice President Taha Yasin Ramadan. Ninety-four Egyptian companies participated. In an interview aired on 18 April on Republic of Iraq radio, Ramadan said: ""Such fairs create awareness among the citizens for the good of Arab industries. We are delighted to see that the Arab countries with which free-trade agreements were signed are setting up such fairs, which provides a chance for better acquaintance with Arab products."" Egypt is not alone in agreeing to a free-trade pact with Iraq. Lebanon and Iraq signed a free-trade pact on 6 April, according to Beirut's Tele-Liban TV. Ramadan signed on behalf of Saddam Husseyn. The Persian Gulf states also are augmenting their trade ties with Iraq. According to a 13 April Omani News Agency report, Iraqi Trade Minister Muhammad Mahdi Salih and his Omani counterpart Maqbul Bin-Ali Sultan signed an agreement to establish a free-trade zone. Maqbul said that Iraq imports two-thirds of Oman's non-oil exports. The Iraqi News Agency on 21 April also reported that the free-trade zone between Iraq and the United Arab Emirates began operation in mid-April. (Michael Rubin)
...BUT ALSO WELCOMES IRAQI KURDISH OFFICIALS. Syria also recently welcomed Mas'ud Barzani, president of the Iraqi opposition KDP. The KDP administers Iraq's Irbil Governorate, as well as the Dahuk Governorate. Additionally, the KDP controls eight kilometers of Iraq's frontier with Syria along the Tigris River. KDP Political Bureau members Azad Barwari, Hoshyar Zebari, and Masrur Barzani accompanied Barzani, according to a 10 April Syrian Arab Republic Radio report. The Kurdish delegation met first with Syrian Vice President 'Abd al-Halim Khaddam, and then with Abadallah al-Ahmar, assistant secretary-general of the (Syrian) Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, as well as ""Comrade"" 'Ali Diyab, director of the Syrian Ba'th Party's foreign relations office. According to the report, ""the two sides stressed that only the Iraqi people should determine their way of progress and the future of their state away from any foreign interference from abroad."" The London-based Arabic daily ""Al-Sharq al-Awsat"" reported on 11 April that, ""Views were identical on the necessity to lift the embargo imposed on the Iraqi people, alleviate their suffering, and reject any military action against Iraq.""
Kurdish media reports cast doubt on whether the Syrian government and the KDP agree on how best to alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people, or what constitutes ""the embargo imposed on the Iraqi people."" Zebari told the Kurdish daily ""Brayati"" in a 9 April interview that a senior U.S. State Department delegation ""reaffirmed the U.S. government's commitment regarding the security and stability of the Kurdistan region against any aggression. They also stressed that the 13 percent share of the Kurdistan region from the revenues of the oil-for-food program will be maintained."" Iraqi Kurdistan's 13 percent share of oil-for-food program revenue is based upon the proportion of the Iraqi population living within the northern Iraqi safe haven. While many Iraqi Kurds also say that they would like to see sanctions lifted eventually, they say that they want to maintain the guarantee of proportional revenue sharing. PUK Prime Minister Barham Salih said in a September 2001 interview with the ""Middle East Intelligence Bulletin,"" ""The oil-for-food program is a great and truly revolutionary concept.... Never in our history have we had a government obliged by international law to devote Iraq's oil revenues to the well-being of the Iraqi people."" (Michael Rubin).
WHEN HUMAN RIGHTS INVESTIGATORS GO HOME. In February 2002, Andreas Mavromatis, a rapporteur for the UN Human Rights Commission (UNHRC), visited Iraq to investigate the Iraqi government's human rights abuses. While Mavromatis sought to engage the Iraqi government in a human rights dialogue, other human rights activists, such as Baktiar Amin of Human Rights Alliance, argued that the Iraqi government's abuses were so vast that no dialogue could be successful (See ""RFE/RL Iraq Report,"" 19 April 2002).
According to the 16 April issue of the London-based Arabic daily ""Al-Sharq al-Awsat,"" Mavromatis's mission did not have an impact on the Iraqi government's attitudes toward human rights. An Iraqi Communist Party report cited in the article said, ""in early March, the authorities executed five citizens from the village of al-Wahhabi in al-Najaf Governorate"" on charges of clashing with the police. In his report to the UNHRC, Mavromatis complained about the ""horrific"" overcrowding in Abu Gharib prison. The Iraqi government moved to rectify this criticism somewhat by executing four prisoners at Abu Gharib on 15 March and executing eight citizens from al-Muthana Governorate six days later. According to the 22 April ""Iraq Press,"" Saddam Husseyn's eldest son, Uday, ordered the imprisonment of Ramzi al-Sa'adun, an editor at the official Arabic-language daily ""Al-Thawra,"" which serves as the mouthpiece of the ruling Ba'th Party. The report did not specify the alleged offense of al-Sa'adun, but it said that he was whipped and then placed in solitary confinement.
On 11 April, the UNHRC voted to condemn Iraqi human rights practices. The adopted resolution ""strongly"" condemning ""the systematic, widespread, and extremely grave violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law by the government of Iraq, resulting in an all-pervasive repression and oppression sustained by broad-based discrimination and widespread terror."" The resolution also noted ""the suppression of freedom of thought, expression, information, association, assembly, and movement through fear of arrest, imprisonment, execution, expulsion, house demolition, and other sanctions;"" as well as ""the repression faced by any kind of opposition, in particular the harassment and intimidation of and threats against Iraqi opponents living abroad and members of their families...summary and arbitrary executions, including political killings and the continued so-called clean-out of prisons, the use of rape as a political tool, as well as enforced or involuntary disappearances...widespread, systematic torture and the maintaining of decrees prescribing cruel and inhuman punishment as a penalty for offences."" The resolution called on the Iraqi government to respect human rights treaties and to allow ""further visits and missions to Iraq by the Special Rapporteur....""
Adding weight to its pronouncement, the UNHRC formally decided to extend the mandate of the special rapporteur by one year. The resolution passed by a vote of 28 to four, with 21 abstentions. Those voting against the resolution were Algeria, Libya, Sudan, and Syria. Among those countries abstaining were China, Russia, India, and South Africa.
Although the UNHRC resolved to extend the mandate of its rapporteur for one year, UN agencies appear unwilling to investigate Iraqi chemical-weapons use, according to a 22 April ""Iraqi Kurdistan Dispatch"" interview with Mike Amitay, director of the Washington Kurdish Institute. ""We have had discussions with appropriate UN agency representatives but have found that while individual officials may be sympathetic, UN agencies are ultimately beholden to Baghdad and unable to assist,"" Amitay said. He added, ""I think this is one of the cruelest ironies of UN [Security Council Resolution] 986 (the ""oil-for-food"" program). It seems clear that the UN should be assisting on numerous levels, yet doing so would anger the Iraqi regime and jeopardize their continued role in administering UN 986 program. In the end, they choose the path of least resistance and avoid the issue."" (Michael Rubin)
SYRIA WELCOMES IRAQI GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS... A series of recent meetings suggests that the often-strained relations between Iraq and neighbor Syria are on the mend. Syrian Arab Republic Radio reported on 7 April that Syrian President Bashar al-Asad had received Iraqi Vice President Taha Yasin Ramadan, as well as the Iraqi Trade Minister Muhammad Mahdi Salih and Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Muhammad Rashid. Meanwhile, Iraq welcomed Syrian Irrigation Minister Muhammad Radwan al-Martini. In an interview aired on state-run Republic of Iraq Television on 6 April, al-Martini said his main goal was ""to deepen ties between the two sisterly Arab countries."" He also said that while he sought ""ways to arrive at an optimal use of the water resources and exchange expertise...everything that serves the two people's interests will also be discussed."" Syria and Iraq signed an irrigation agreement and agreed to establish joint companies. Both Iraqi Irrigation Minister Abdul Husseyn Suwadi and al-Martini called on Turkey to resume tripartite talks over sharing of Euphrates water halted since 1992.
Syria also supports Iraq's unilateral oil embargo. According to a 16 April Iraqi News Agency report, Syrian Prime Minister Muhammad Mustafa Miru expressed his appreciation for Husseyn's decision to stop oil exports for 30 days. Iraqi oil continues to flow to Syria, though, despite the embargo (see ""RFE/RL Iraq Report,"" 19 April 2002). Miru made his comments to a visiting Iraqi trade delegation. The Iraqi and Syrian businessmen agreed that the recently signed free-trade accord between Iraq and Syria would have a ""positive impact"" upon ""the two people."" (Michael Rubin)
IRAQI KURDISTAN RECONSTRUCTION CONTINUES. The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), in conjunction with private investment, will renovate Irbil's landmark Sheraton Hotel, the 31 March ""Kurdistan Today,"" reported. The $6 million investment will be completed within a year. The 10-story hotel, to be renamed the Hawler Hotel (Hawler is the Kurdish name of Irbil) will have indoor and outdoor restaurants, a swimming pool and cinema, a small shopping mall, and conference facilities. As the northern Iraqi economy improves under the ""oil-for-food"" program, numerous other hotel projects have been completed recently. Turkish investment helped reconstruct the five-star Jiyan Hotel in Dahuk, and the Sulaymaniyah palace hotel recently reopened after a multimillion-dollar renovation. In addition, both the Ashti and the Abu Sina hotels in Sulaymaniyah have undergone renovations. Because of the increasing numbers of foreign visitors, as well as internal Iraqi travel, the hotels are increasingly full.
There have been several other recent development projects in Kurdish-administered northern Iraq, according to the 31 March ""Kurdistan Today."" The KRG's Ministry of Agriculture recently opened three new oil-for-food-program-funded irrigation projects. The UN has awarded local companies the contracts to execute the project. Under terms of the 20 May 1996 UN-Iraqi government memorandum of understanding, the UN implements oil-for-food projects on behalf the central Iraqi government in the three northern governorates of Sulaymaniyah, Irbil, and Dahuk.
In order to respect Iraqi sovereignty, the UN recognizes neither the results of the 1992 elections that led to the rise of the PUK and KDP, nor the 2001 municipal elections that occurred with the three Kurdish-administered provinces of Iraq. Elections in Iraqi Kurdistan are contested and are not limited only to candidates of Saddam Husseyn's Ba'th Party. In some ways, the UN oversight of contracts has bolstered the Iraqi Kurdish economy, at least compared to that in Husseyn's portion of Iraq. In portions of Iraq under Husseyn's control, the Iraqi government awards contracts without competitive bidding, according to a European diplomat in Amman. Money from the oil-for-food program is much more equitably distributed in the Iraqi safe haven than in portions of Iraq governed by Husseyn; it does not only go to companies run by Ba'th Party officials.
Many KRG officials, however, are not satisfied with the ""slow pace"" of UN aid programs. PUK Deputy Prime Minister Adnan Mufti met with a delegation of the United Nations Development Program and criticized it for the slow pace of its operations, according to the 19 April issue of ""Al-Ittihad,"" the Arabic-language daily newspaper of the PUK. According to ""Al-Ittihad,"" Mufti ""called on the UN to play its role in dealing with failures and shortcomings in the electricity sector and consolidating cooperation and coordination with the institutions of the Kurdistan Regional Government."" Mufti also requested the UN speed up organization of teacher-training courses, and ""to respond to the needs of the health and agriculture sectors."" (Some Iraqi Kurdish hospital officials interviewed in spring 2001 said that the UN often takes up to 18 months to deliver approved equipment. If that equipment is faulty, then another 18 months can be wasted waiting for replacement parts.)
Many Iraqi Kurds complain that the UN does not respond to their needs and concerns; they say that many Arab national UN employees, such as those from Egypt, Yemen, Jordan, and Sudan are especially unresponsive. According to a 27 March 2001 United Press International report, Husseyn pressured UN agencies to ""do his bidding in northern Iraq."" The article pointed to one example where Rima al-Azar, a Lebanese UNICEF child protection officer in Irbil, unilaterally severed UNICEF's contracts with NGOs operating in Iraqi Kurdistan, apparently without any authorization from her superiors or UN offices in Geneva and New York. There have been other problems with the UN. According to farmers and officials of the University of Sulaymani College of Agriculture, a pesticide supplied to farmers by the UN wiped out nearly the entire chickpea crop in spring 2001, leaving several farmers who had sought UN agricultural advice destitute.
The KRG in Irbil also reported in its online ""Round-up"" for April 2002 (http://www.krg.org/news) that residents may soon place international telephone calls directly from their homes. For the past decade, all international calls were placed through local telephone centers. (According to local residents, these family-run centers double as money-transfer centers; Kurdish expatriates can deposit money with a European branch of the phone center, which will then transfer the amount minus a set commission to their relatives at the company's Iraqi Kurdish branch). The direct international dial capability is a joint project of the KRG's Ministry of Transportation and Communications and the local Irbil-based Korek Telecom Company, ""Round-up"" reported. Also bolstering communications for local residents is the inauguration of a new Kurdistan-Net Internet service provider. The company will offer both unlimited and by-the-hour Internet packages, according to ""Round-up."" There are several dozen Internet cafes throughout northern Iraq, with more than 30 in Sulaymaniyah alone. Residents there have had dial-up access by subscription for more than a year. In portions of Iraq governed by Saddam Husseyn's Ba'th Party, there are five Internet cafes (see ""RFE/RL Iraq Report,"" 19 January 2001). (Michael Rubin)
TENSIONS MOUNT BETWEEN SECULAR, ISLAMIST KURDISH GROUPS. Tensions are increasing between the secular PUK and militant Kurdish parties following the 2 April assassination attempt on PUK Prime Minister Salih and a rumored 18 March attempt on the life of KDP President Mas'ud Barzani (see ""RFE/RL Iraq Report,"" 5 April 2002). The Islamist parties are based near Tawella, in the mountains along the Iran-Iraq border. The Iranian government facilitates transport of men and material to the militant Islamist group, according to the December 2001 ""Middle East Intelligence Bulletin.""
The assassination attempt on Salih has furthered reconciliation between the PUK and KDP, according to a 15 April report in the Iraqi Kurdish newspaper ""Hawlati."" The often-strained relations have warmed steadily since the appointment of Salih to the PUK premiership in January 2001. According to ""Hawlati,"" the KDP and PUK ""decided to set up an operations room in order to follow and gather information on people and terrorist groups who may be active in Kurdistan.""

BAGHDAD REAFFIRMS SUPPORT FOR SUICIDE BOMBERS. The Persian Gulf states also are augmenting their trade ties with Iraq. According to a 13 April Omani News Agency report, Iraqi Trade Minister Muhammad Mahdi Salih and his Omani counterpart Maqbul Bin-Ali Sultan signed an agreement to establish a free-trade zone. The Iraqi News Agency on 21 April also reported that the free-trade zone between Iraq and the United Arab Emirates began operation in mid-April.

PUK Prime Minister Barham Salih said in a September 2001 interview with the ""Middle East Intelligence Bulletin,"" ""The oil-for-food program is a great and truly revolutionary concept....

"" We have had discussions with appropriate UN agency representatives but have found that while individual officials may be sympathetic, UN agencies are ultimately beholden to Baghdad and unable to assist,"" Amitay said.

IRAQI KURDISTAN RECONSTRUCTION CONTINUES. Because of the increasing numbers of foreign visitors, as well as internal Iraqi travel, the hotels are increasingly full. Under terms of the 20 May 1996 UN-Iraqi government memorandum of understanding, the UN implements oil-for-food projects on behalf the central Iraqi government in the three northern governorates of Sulaymaniyah, Irbil, and Dahuk. In some ways, the UN oversight of contracts has bolstered the Iraqi Kurdish economy, at least compared to that in Husseyn's portion of Iraq. In portions of Iraq under Husseyn's control, the Iraqi government awards contracts without competitive bidding, according to a European diplomat in Amman. If that equipment is faulty, then another 18 months can be wasted waiting for replacement parts.) There have been other problems with the UN. For the past decade, all international calls were placed through local telephone centers. ( Residents there have had dial-up access by subscription for more than a year.

In May 2016, investigative news website Mediapart and radio station France Inter published and broadcast accounts from 14 women who alleged Denis Baupin had groped, “sexted” and otherwise harassed them.
Mr Baupin, a prominent Green Party member and former Paris city official, is also launching the defamation lawsuit against four journalists who reported the allegations.

He resigned as vice president of the lower house of parliament when the reports surfaced, denying all the allegations against him.
The next month, Mr Baupin sued the journalists, the six accusers who agreed to be named in the news reports and two men who were quoted corroborating some of the alleged misbehaviour.

Mr Baupin’s lawyer, Emmanuel Pierrat, said his client did nothing illegal and now wants to “fully clear his name”.
Mr Pierrat said the lawsuit’s main goal is to prove the investigative website and radio station were not fair in their coverage.
The lawyer told the Associated Press “his reputation, his family, his life were broken” by the allegations.
Most of the women who spoke about Mr Baupin’s alleged behaviour from 1998 to 2013 were fellow Green Party members and their descriptions sparking outrage. Four filed criminal complaints for sexual harassment.
A nine-month judicial investigation ended without charges.

Prosecutors said the three-year statute of limitations had expired, but released a statement saying the women’s “measured, constant statements” and witness corroboration created a set of facts to support allegations of actions that “may for some of them be classified as criminal”.
Journalists and individuals need to show they acted in good faith or prove they told the truth as a defence against defamation under French law. A conviction is punishable by a maximum fine of €45,000 (£39,000).
Media reports are also assessed by the additional criteria of the legitimacy of journalists’ goals in producing a story, whether they demonstrate an absence of personal animosity, prudence and balance, and the quality of the investigation.
Mr Pierrat said “none of them is fulfilled” in the Mediapart and France Inter pieces on Mr Baupin.
Three defendants in the defamation trial said they also plan to speak in a Paris courtroom for other women who requested anonymity or did not air their experiences.
Sandrine Rousseau, a former Green Party spokeswoman who accused Mr Baupin of grabbing her breast at a 2011 meeting, said: “The question is: will justice send the message that women must remain silent?
“It’s an important message, a message saying that women can speak out – or not.”
Annie Lahmer, another Green who serves on the Paris regional council said she deems it to be her “duty” to speak out.
Ms Lahmer alleges Mr Baupin chased her around an office desk while she tried to escape his grasp in 1999, when she was a Green Party employee and he was national party spokesperson. Ms Lahmer alleges Mr Baupin told her she would not be able to have a career in the party after she made it clear she would not tolerate such behaviour.
“In court, I’m going to say it’s inadmissible that some men who hold power consider that kind of behaviour as normal. It is not,” she said.
Isabelle Attard, a former politician, alleged he sexually harassed her with dozens of inappropriate text messages in 2012 and 2013. Ms Attard said it has been difficult for her to break years of silence and hopes growing awareness and support from the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and assault gives other women “more courage to say no and speak out”.
“I was just an activist who then became a lawmaker facing someone very prominent in the party,” Ms Attard said of how she felt when the alleged misconduct happened.
“I did not feel on an equal footing with him.”
France’s secretary of state for women’s rights, Marlène Schiappa, said there has been an “enormous backlash” to the #MeToo movement which challenges “a sexism very deeply anchored in our society”.
She said: “What I deplore is that in a general way, whenever a woman talks about sexual or sexist assault, you start to dig into the woman’s life and put this woman into a position of being accused.”
Ms Schiappa said she would not specifically comment on the Baupin case because it is going to court. She said “a very little bit of progress” has been made in France since 2016 via new laws aimed at better protecting victims of sexual violence and pushing gender equality.
French politicians passed a bill that extended the three-year statute of limitations on sexual harassment claims to six years.
Last month, a report found more than a million French women were forced to endure sexist insults in 2017 with only four convictions for breaches of sexual harassment laws. The report by France’s High Council for Gender Equality was the major first investigation into sexism to be carried out in France.
Sexist insults are described in the research as “daily violence” faced by women. The most frequently reported insults were salope (slut), pute (whore) and connasse (bitch).
Last year politicians approved legislation which introduced fines of up to €750 for wolf-whistling or sexual harassment on the street.

Ukraine crisis provokes more economic sanctions against Russia,www.cbc.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ukraine-crisis-provokes-more-economic-sanctions-against-russia-1.2639779,13-05-14 9:00,"The economic sanctions that Western nations and Japan have brought against Russia over Ukraine have targeted people and businesses, with travel bans and asset freezes hitting individuals who are considered to be close financially or politically to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
World leaders have also dangled the prospect of harsher actions in economically sensitive areas such as energy if Russia disrupts elections to choose a successor to ousted Ukranian President Victor Yanukovych on May 25.
Canada's sanctions have focused on senior officials, businesses and some institutions in Russia and Ukraine.
""Until Russia clearly demonstrates its respect for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, Canada will continue to work with its allies and like-minded countries to apply pressure that will further isolate Russia economically and politically,"" Prime Minister Stephen Harper has said.
The most recent international action came Monday, when Canada added six Russians and six Ukrainians to its sanctions list. Earlier in the day, the European Union added 13 individuals and two businesses to its list.
Notably absent from everyone's sanctions lists are the top officials with Gazprom, the Russian energy behemoth that supplies Western Europe with much of its natural gas, and is half-owned by the Russian government.
EU ministers agreed to expand visa bans and asset freezes to hit people considered to be undermining stability in Ukraine, or obstructing international organizations there. Monday's move marked the first time corporations were targeted by the EU.
The international sanctions followed Russia's annexation of the Crimean region after the March 16 referendum, and escalated because of the current standoff over Eastern Ukraine.
Here's a look at some of the sanctions so far.
Canada
On Monday, the federal government added the names of six Russians and six Ukrainians to the list of those who face economic sanctions and travel bans. So far, Canada has issued sanctions against 62 individuals and 19 entities, including some banks. The Russian names added Monday are:
Valery Gerasimov Vasilevich , chief of the general staff of the armed forces of the Russian Federation.
Gerasimov Vasilevich Igor Girkin (also known as Igor Strelkov), a member of the main intelligence directorate of the general staff of the armed forces.
Sergei Ivanovich Menyailo, acting governor of the Ukrainian city of Sevastopol.
Sergei Ivanovich Neverov, deputy chairman of the State Duma, Russia's parliament
Oleg Savelyev Genirokhovich, minister for Crimean affairs.​
Ludmila Ivanovna Shvetsova, deputy chairman of the State Duma.
Ukrainian individuals targeted are:
Olga Fedorovna Kovatidi, a member of the Russian Federation Council from the Autonomous Republic of Crimea.
German Prokopiv, leader of the Luhansk Guard.
Valeriy Bolotov, retired officer and chair of airborne troop veterans of Luhansk.
Andriy Purgin, head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk Republic.
Denys Pushylin, a leader of the Donetsk Republic.
Sergey Gennadevich Tsyplakov, one of the leaders of the People's Militia of Donbass.
Harper said the 12 individuals targeted by Monday's sanctions ""have facilitated Russia's violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity.""
Monday's announcement came a week after Ottawa imposed sanctions on 16 Russian ""entities,"" mainly banks and companies.
That expansion of sanctions followed travel bans on April 28 against another nine individuals:
Vyaecheslav Volodin, first deputy chief.
Dmitry Kozak, deputy prime minister.
Aleksey Pushkov, chair of Duma international relations committee.
Alexander Mikhailovich Babakov, chair of the Duma commission on legislative provisions for development of the military-industrial complex of the Russian Federation.
Oleg Evgenyevich Belaventsev, Russian presidential envoy to the Crimean district; member of the Russian security council.
Evgeniy Alexsevevich Morov, director of the Federal Protective Service of the Russian Federation.
Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovsky, founder and leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia.
Arkady Rotenberg, Russian businessman.
Boris Rotenberg, Russian businessman.
Two organizations — ExpoBank and RosEnergoBank — were also targeted.
The Canadian sanctions followed similar actions that day by the U.S.
A Russian diplomat was also ordered to leave Canada in April in retaliation for a Canadian envoy's expulsion from Moscow.
United States
The U.S. has published three lists of individuals and companies targeted by travel bans and asset freezes.
The most recent came on April 28. That list featured seven government officials, including two the U.S. Treasury Department described as ""key members of the Russian leadership's inner circle,"" and 17 entities.
Those entities include InvestCapitalBank and SMP Bank, which the Treasury Department said are controlled by Arkady Rotenberg and Boris Rotenberg, who are also the target of Canadian sanctions.
Russian businessman and billionaire Gennady Timchenko has been targeted by U.S. sanctions over Russian actions in Ukraine. (Alexander Nikolayev/Interpress/Associated Press) ​Arkady Rotenberg has longstanding personal ties with Putin, the BBC reported, noting they belonged to the same St. Petersburg judo club years ago.
Other individuals targeted by the U.S. who also appear on Canada's list include Oleg Belaventsev and Dmitry Kozak.
The U.S. and Canada have also issued sanctions against Gennady Timchenko, a man the BBC describes as a long-standing friend of Putin and one who Forbes says has a net worth of $13.9 billion. Timchenko sold his 43 per cent stake in the Gunvor Group, an international energy trader, one day before the U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on him, Forbes said.
Yuri Kovalchuk, the largest single shareholder in Bank Rossiya, has also been targeted by the U.S.
The BBC reported Kovalchuk has been described as one of Putin's ""cashiers"" and is a close adviser to him.
Some U.S. politicians have urged the White House to extend sanctions to Gazprom, the Russian natural gas state monopoly.
So far, however, the energy firm remains untouched. ""I think our president is taking a cautious approach warranted because our European allies are ... trade partners with Russia, they depend on Russia's energy. And so we have [to] be careful because sanctions against Russia also have the good probability of hurting our allies,"" U.S. representative Lois Frankel said during an American TV appearance, the Christian Science Monitor reported.
But one U.S. senator has urged U.S. President Barack Obama to put Gazprom on the sanction list.
""Unless Russia ends its destabilization of Eastern Ukraine and drastically reduces troop levels on the Ukrainian border immediately, further sanctions against strategic sectors of the Russian economy, particularly targeting Gazprom and additional important financial institutions, should be imposed within days,"" Tennessee Senator Bob Corker wrote in a letter to Obama on April 12.
European Union
Closer to the Ukraine and Russia, sanctions have not been as extensive as they have been in the U.S.
Europe's action on Monday brings its total to 61 individuals.
The EU also extended sanctions to two Crimean companies, marking the first time Europe targeted corporations, but the measures still ""fell far short"" of sanctions imposed by the U.S., Reuters reported.
""The EU's reticence to go further and impose tough economic sanctions on Russia over its support for pro-Russian groups in Ukraine reflects concerns among many of its member states about trade and industrial ties and heavy reliance on Russian energy.""
Additional EU sanctions may be imposed if ""actions and provocations"" hamper the Ukraine presidential election campaign, France's European affairs minister, Harlem Desir, said.
On the weekend, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande issued a similar message.
They said they would support tougher sanctions in areas such as energy or defence.
Economic concerns could play into any consideration of sanctions by Germany, with Stern magazine noting the country's growth could be cut by 0.9 percentage points if harsher sanctions were introduced, Reuters reported.",sergey gennadevich tsyplakov,13-05-14 9:00,ef07ba2a2596b26bbaacaac33304d53e35a01f74d13df007632dfe39b59adabc,0.805892851,"[{'score': 0.5187453627586365, 'topic': 'assets'}, {'score': 0.415853887796402, 'topic': 'misconduct'}, {'score': 1.0, 'topic': 'sanctions'}, {'score': 0.4152112603187561, 'topic': 'cyber'}]","[{'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.4182842969894409, 'name': 'Vladimir Putin', 'topic': 'assets'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.44527435302734375, 'name': 'Vladimir Putin', 'topic': 'sanctions'}, {'sentiment': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.40432488918304443, 'name': 'Vladimir Putin', 'topic': 'terrorism'}, {'sentiment': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.37423089146614075, 'name': 'Oleg Evgenyevich Belaventsev', 'topic': 'sanctions'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.3889826238155365, 'name': 'Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovsky', 'topic': 'assets'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.466858446598053, 'name': 'Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovsky', 'topic': 'sanctions'}, {'sentiment': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.4935070276260376, 'name': 'Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovsky', 'topic': 'terrorism'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.4688328206539154, 'name': 'Oleg Savelyev Genirokhovich', 'topic': 'sanctions'}, {'sentiment': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.44933393597602844, 'name': 'Barack Obama', 'topic': 'sanctions'}, {'sentiment': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.36374756693840027, 'name': 'Barack Obama', 'topic': 'assets'}, {'sentiment': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.40095633268356323, 'name': 'Gennady Timchenko', 'topic': 'assets'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.5755857825279236, 'name': 'Gennady Timchenko', 'topic': 'sanctions'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.428762286901474, 'name': 'Oleg Belaventsev', 'topic': 'sanctions'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.46476101875305176, 'name': 'Bob Corker', 'topic': 'assets'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.4242881238460541, 'name': 'Bob Corker', 'topic': 'sanctions'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.4745020568370819, 'name': 'Dmitry Kozak', 'topic': 'sanctions'}, {'sentiment': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.4375349283218384, 'name': 'Stephen Harper', 'topic': 'sanctions'}, {'sentiment': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.3461044430732727, 'name': 'Stephen Harper', 'topic': 'money_laundering'}, {'sentiment': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.3564709424972534, 'name': 'State Duma', 'topic': 'assets'}, {'sentiment': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.43794766068458557, 'name': 'State Duma', 'topic': 'sanctions'}]","The economic sanctions that Western nations and Japan have brought against Russia over Ukraine have targeted people and businesses, with travel bans and asset freezes hitting individuals who are considered to be close financially or politically to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

"U.S. sanctions companies, people over Russia actions in Ukraine",www.reuters.com,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-sanctions-russia/u-s-sanctions-companies-people-over-russia-actions-in-ukraine-idUSKBN1492AH,20-12-16 23:23,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Tuesday targeted more Russian businessmen and companies over Russia’s annexation of Crimea and the conflict in Ukraine, slapping them with U.S. sanctions in a move Moscow criticized as hostile.

The measures come a month before U.S. President Barack Obama hands over power to President-elect Donald Trump, who has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and said it would be good if the two countries could get along.
Trump’s nominee for U.S. Secretary of State, Exxon Mobil Corp Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson, has opposed U.S. sanctions on Russia, which awarded him a friendship medal in 2013.
The United States introduced sanctions on Russia after it annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 and expanded them over its support for separatist rebels in the East of the country.
But it is unclear if the United States will maintain the sanctions on Russia under Trump, who could lift the executive orders that authorize the measures.
In a statement, the U.S. Treasury named seven Russian businessmen, six of whom it said were executives at Bank Rossiya or its affiliates ABR Management and Sobinbank. The U.S. Treasury has called Bank Rossiya “the personal bank for officials of the Russian Federation” and had previously sanctioned it and the two affiliates.
One of the men named on Tuesday was Kirill Kovalchuk, whom Russian media have identified as a nephew of Yuri Kovalchuk, a major shareholder in Bank Rossiya. The United States sanctioned Yuri Kovalchuk in 2014, saying he was a close adviser to Putin and his personal banker.
The U.S. Treasury also sanctioned several companies and government enterprises for operating in Crimea, including two Russian firms it said were helping to build a multi-billion dollar bridge to link the Russian mainland with the peninsula, a project important to Putin.
The U.S. actions bar American individuals or companies from dealing with the sanctioned people or companies.
Treasury also named 26 subsidiaries of Russian Agricultural Bank and gas producer Novatek, both of which had already been sanctioned in 2014. U.S. sanctions on those companies are relatively narrow and prohibit Americans from dealing in certain kinds of debt with them.
Novatek is Russia’s largest non-state gas producer. Its chief executive and major shareholder is Leonid Mikhelson, one of Russia’s richest men.
Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told TASS news agency that the sanctions were hostile acts by the outgoing Obama administration and Russia would expand its sanctions lists against the United States in response.
“We retain the right to choose the time, place and form of our responsive actions in a way that suits us,” Ryabkov told TASS.
RUSSIA HOPES FOR EASING OF SANCTIONS UNDER TRUMP
U.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby in a news briefing on Tuesday denied suggestions that the timing of the measures was related to the transition next month.
“This decision by the Treasury Department had nothing to do with the time on the clock,” Kirby said. “It had everything to do with Russia’s activities and support for the separatists in Ukraine and for their occupation of Crimea.”
The U.S. move comes a day after the European Union formally extended its economic sanctions on Russia’s defense, energy and financial sectors until mid-2017, a move E.U. leaders agreed to last week.
Trump’s election - and the mutual praise between him and Putin - has stoked hopes in Russia that Western sanctions might be eased or lifted under his presidency, potentially spurring investment in Russia’s flat-lining economy.
A reversal by Trump of existing sanctions, or a softer U.S. stance on enforcing them, could also weaken European sanctions resolve.
Valentina Matviyenko, the speaker of the Federation Council, the upper house of parliament, told a news conference on Tuesday that Trump’s forthcoming arrival in the White House promised to create the conditions for better U.S.-Russia relations.

Commenting on what she referred to as “anti-Russian sanctions,” Matviyenko, a close ally of Putin, said she was sure that Western sanctions would be eased or lifted altogether in 2017.
Trump may face opposition to easing restrictions on doing business with Russia by the U.S. Congress, which has shown it has little patience for the Kremlin’s military adventures.
Both Republicans and Democrats have expressed concerns about Tillerson’s ties to Russia, and many Republicans, in contrast to Trump, view Putin as a calculating, untrustworthy foe.",yuri valentinovich kovalchuk,20-12-16 23:23,edb35d4b89d0cfabad04342f164b9ed80f30257bcd91bf46861e20f780bf7052,0.802150677,"[{'score': 0.4129389822483063, 'topic': 'embezzlement'}, {'score': 0.47348475456237793, 'topic': 'assets'}, {'score': 0.4181244671344757, 'topic': 'tax_evasion'}, {'score': 0.4500616192817688, 'topic': 'money_laundering'}, {'score': 1.0, 'topic': 'sanctions'}, {'score': 0.43965691328048706, 'topic': 'bribery'}]","[{'sentiment': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.4130564332008362, 'name': 'Donald Trump', 'topic': 'sanctions'}, {'sentiment': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.41427090764045715, 'name': 'Donald Trump', 'topic': 'terrorism'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.4530267119407654, 'name': 'Vladimir Putin', 'topic': 'sanctions'}, {'sentiment': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.34503263235092163, 'name': 'Barack Obama', 'topic': 'sanctions'}, {'sentiment': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.4044000506401062, 'name': 'Barack Obama', 'topic': 'cyber'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.39724889397621155, 'name': 'Valentina Matviyenko', 'topic': 'sanctions'}, {'sentiment': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.4049121141433716, 'name': 'John Kirby', 'topic': 'sanctions'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.40886345505714417, 'name': 'Sergei Ryabkov', 'topic': 'sanctions'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.5185120105743408, 'name': 'Sergei Ryabkov', 'topic': 'cyber'}]","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Tuesday targeted more Russian businessmen and companies over Russia’s annexation of Crimea and the conflict in Ukraine, slapping them with U.S. sanctions in a move Moscow criticized as hostile.

Profile: Laurent Nkunda,www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/23/profile-laurent-nkunda-congo,23-01-09 0:00,"Laurent Nkunda, the Congolese warlord with a penchant for sunglasses and crisp uniforms who was arrested today, is generally described as a ""rogue general"" but experts, such as Gerard Prunier, say this minimises his importance as a persistent source of instability in a chronically volatile region in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Nkunda, 40, studied psychology and has been a soldier since 1993. Although born in Congo, he fought with the Rwandan Patriotic Front, the rebel movement formed by Rwandan Tutsi exiles that seized control of Rwanda in 1994, ending the genocide perpetrated by Hutu extremists.
Afterwards, Nkunda returned to Congo where in 1998 he became senior officer in the Rwandan-backed Rally for Congolese Democracy Goma (RCD-Goma), one of the main rebel groups in a tangled internecine conflict that embroiled several countries in the region from Angola to Uganda.
Congo's wars killed five million people. When they supposedly ended in 2003, the RCD joined the national army of the transitional government. Nkunda was made a general in 2004, but refused to report to Kinshasa as part of the new integrated army and withdrew with hundreds of his former troops to the forests of Masisi in North Kivu in eastern Congo.
In August 2005, Nkunda declared the Congolese government corrupt and incompetent and called for its overthrow. At first he did not represent much of a threat but he went on to capitalise on the government's weakness. In 2006 he created the Congrès National pour la Défense du Peuple (CNDP), a political armed militia to ""clean up Congolese politics"". Under the CNDP banner, Nkunda recruited all sorts of malcontents, mostly Tutsi but also Hutus and former fighters who had been demobilised and left with nothing to do.
A slim bespectacled figure who often wore a military beret and carried a cane topped with a silver eagle's head, Nkunda often received reporters at his hilltop HQ in North Kivu.
As part of his image, Nkunda maintained that his group existed to protect the Congolese Tutsi, known locally as Banyamulenge, from the Hutu remnants who fled to eastern Congo after the Rwandan genocide. Independent investigations say there have been some attacks on Banyamulenge but not to the extent he claimed. Many regard Nkunda as simply a warlord operating with Rwandan backing and under whose watch human rights abuses took place, including atrocities in 2002 when he was a commander in the diamond-rich town of Kisangani. The Human Rights Watch group has documented summary executions, torture, and rape committed by soldiers under Nkunda's command.
During the offensive in October that brought a humanitarian crisis to eastern Congo, displacing hundreds of thousands of people, Nkunda threatened to take the fight all the way to Kinshasa.
But now the man who led a rebel force of about 5,000 troops is facing jail after his arrest by Congolese and Rwandan military commanders. For Nkunda, the arrest amounts to a sharp switch by the Rwandan government, which found him useful in the past. Now it has disowned the leader of one of the most dangerous armed groups in the east of the DRC.
The writing was on the wall for Nkunda when his former chief of staff, Bosco Ntaganda, formed a splinter movement last month. Nkunda's position became even more precarious when Ntaganda announced his forces would work together with Congo's army and eventually integrate with it. Ntaganda may have turned on his former boss because he was afraid months of growing distrust might have prompted Nkunda to turn him over to the international criminal court in The Hague, Netherlands, where Nkunda is wanted for the alleged forced conscription of child soldiers.
As for Rwanda, Paul Kagame's government may have decided that its protege had become too big for his boots as well as too much of a liability by creating instability on its border with an offensive that created so much human suffering and earned international opprobrium.",laurent nkunda,23-01-09 0:00,cae04772f42e2a7a2c0f8c62d8f27a37348054023dc57609b77937bb4554d4c7,0.685532544,"[{'score': 0, 'topic': 'None'}]","[{'sentiment': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.40911203622817993, 'name': 'Laurent Nkunda', 'topic': 'terrorism'}, {'sentiment': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.5429984331130981, 'name': 'Gerard Prunier', 'topic': 'terrorism'}]","Laurent Nkunda, the Congolese warlord with a penchant for sunglasses and crisp uniforms who was arrested today, is generally described as a ""rogue general"" but experts, such as Gerard Prunier, say this minimises his importance as a persistent source of instability in a chronically volatile region in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

"US Issues Additional Russian/Ukrainian Designations and New General License, EU Extends Sanctions Targeting Russia",www.jdsupra.com,https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/us-issues-additional-russian-ukrainian-70784/,26-07-20 0:00,"On December 20, 2016, the US Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) added 15 individuals and entities and two vessels to the List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN List) and identified certain subsidiaries of entities included on the Sectoral Sanctions Identifications List (SSI List). The US Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) is in the process of finalizing a companion rule for publication that will amend the Entity List in conjunction with certain entities designated by OFAC.
OFAC also issued General License No. 11 which authorizes certain transactions that are ordinarily incident and necessary for US persons to request, contract for, pay for, receive or utilize a project design review or permit from the Russian federal institution FAU Glavgosekspertiza Rossii, which was designated as an SDN earlier this year.1
This action follows the December 19 extension by the European Union of sanctions against Russia regarding Ukraine until July 31, 2017.2
New Additions to the SDN List
The US designated six individuals, each of whom holds an executive position within Bank Rossiya, ABR Management or Sobinbank. In addition, one individual was designated in connection with business dealings involving the Russian Ministry of Defense.
Four construction and transportation entities were designated for operating in the Crimea region of Ukraine and an additional four entities were designated for supporting OJSC Sovfracht. OFAC also designated the vessels ""Marshal Zhukov"" and ""Stalingrad"" as property in which Trans-Flot JSC has an interest.
All property and interests in property of these individuals and entities located in the United States or within the possession or control of a US person3, wherever located, are considered blocked and may not be dealt in. Any entity in which one or more blocked persons holds a 50 percent or greater ownership interest in the aggregate is itself considered blocked by operation of law.4 US persons may not engage in any dealings, directly or indirectly, with blocked persons.

New Additions to the SSI List
The United States identified on the SSI List a number of subsidiaries owned 50 percent or more by two SSIs, the Russian Agricultural Bank and OAO Novatek. The Russian Agricultural Bank was originally designated on July 29, 2014 pursuant to Directive 1, which targets the Russian financial services sector. Directive 1 prohibits US persons from engaging in, directly or indirectly, all transactions in provision of financing for, and other dealings in new debt of longer than 30 days maturity or new equity of persons determined to be subject to Directive 1, their property, or their interests in property.
OAO Novatek was designated on July 16, 2014 pursuant to Directive 2, which targets the Russian energy sector. Directive 2 prohibits US persons from engaging in, directly or indirectly, all transactions in provision of financing for, and other dealings in new debt of longer than 90 days maturity or new equity of persons determined to be subject to Directive 2, their property, or their interests in property.
OFAC stated that, although these entities already were subject by operation of law to the same restrictions as their parent entities due to the 50 percent or greater ownership interest by SSIs, their identification on the SSI List will help the public more effectively comply with sanctions.5

Iqra Khalid (born November 20, 1985) is a Canadian politician who was elected to represent the riding of Mississauga—Erin Mills in the House of Commons of Canada in the 2015 federal election.[2]
Early life and education [ edit ]
Khalid was born in Bahawalpur Punjab, Pakistan.[3] In 1993 her family moved to England while her father completed his PhD. In 1998 her family immigrated to Canada, where her parents started a small family business in Mississauga. Iqra and her three brothers helped at this store while they attended school.[4] Khalid attended York University, where she graduated with a degree in criminology and professional writing in 2007. As a student she served as the media ambassador for the York University Student Alumni Program,[5] and as the president of the Pakistani Students Federation where she organized a campaign to raise funds and emergency supplies for victims of the 2005 Kashmir Earthquake.[6]
Following her graduation she began working at an immigration firm. She then went on to pursue a Juris Doctorate at Western Michigan University Cooley Law School. She completed the three-year program in only two.[7] She wrote her final thesis on a comparative analysis of the effects of culture on the governance and regulation of a nation, using business law in the USA, Canada, India and China as case studies. She graduated with honors distinction in 2012. She then returned to Canada and began working as an articled clerk for the city of Mississauga.[8][9]

Democrats to propose sweeping policing reform package in response to George Floyd's death,abcnews.go.com,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-propose-sweeping-policing-reform-package-response-george/story?id=71109081,06-06-20 20:30,"Democrats to propose sweeping policing reform package in response to George Floyd's death It is expected to be formally introduced Monday.
House and Senate Democrats on Monday are expected to unveil a sweeping package of police reforms in response to the death of George Floyd and other troubling encounters between African Americans and the police.
The Justice in Policing Act of 2020 would limit qualified immunity protections, create a national police misconduct registry, ban chokeholds, restrict the transfer of military-grade equipment to police departments and make lynching a federal crime, among other provisions, according to a section-by-section summary of the proposal sent to Democratic offices Friday night and obtained by ABC News. Democrats are still finalizing the proposal ahead of its formal release next week.
""While there is no single policy prescription that will erase the decades of systemic racism and excessive policing - it's time we create structural change with meaningful reforms,"" Congressional Black Caucus Chair. Karen Bass, D-Calif., House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., and Sens. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Kamala Harris, D-Calif., the main sponsors of the legislation, said in a ""Dear Colleague"" letter Friday evening.
The proposal circulated Friday evening would impose new conditions on funding for law enforcement. Federal funds would be tied to banning the use of chokeholds and carotid holds. And they would also be conditioned on protocols to discourage racial profiling and mandatory racial and implicit bias training programs.

It would also create a federal registry of law enforcement officers at all levels to gather misconduct complaints, discipline and termination records, to discourage the hiring of police officers with ""problematic"" records in other jurisdictions, according to the summary.
According to the highlights shared with Democrats on Friday night, the package would require states to report use-of-force incidents against civilians or law enforcement officers to the Justice Department and provide funding to smaller police departments to encourage the collection and reporting of policing data.
The package also includes provisions designed to make it easier to prosecute police officers for misconduct, changing the criminal intent standard from ""willfulness"" violation of a person's constitutional rights to ""recklessness"" in the relevant federal law.
It would make it easier for individuals to seek damages from police officers by limiting the qualified immunity doctrine that has protected law enforcement officers from civil lawsuits.
The package, which is expected to face resistance from elements of the law enforcement community, could be approved by the House later this month. But it's not clear how many Republicans will support the effort, and the GOP-led Senate is expected to take up more limited proposals.
Some Republicans have called for improving police training, increasing the reporting of officer-related shooting data, and making it easier to fire police officers charged repeatedly charged with misconduct.
The House Judiciary Committee will hold its first hearing on police brutality since Floyd’s death on Wednesday, featuring testimony from his brother.

UN sanctions on Darfur suspects,news.bbc.co.uk,http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4942026.stm,26-04-06 10:23,"Civilians described attacks by government aircraft and militiamen
The four include two rebel leaders, a former Sudanese air force chief, and the leader of a pro-government militia, accused of widespread atrocities.
In Darfur itself, a BBC correspondent has found evidence of continuing attacks on civilians by militias.
Violence in Darfur has killed some 100,000 people and created 2m refugees.
Last week, the top UN aid official said the humanitarian situation in Darfur was as bad as when the conflict came to the world's attention in 2004.
The BBC's Orla Guerin in Darfur met streams of civilians who said they were fleeing their remote village of Jogana.
They said they had been attacked by government aircraft and militiamen that were fighting rebel forces in the area.
Our correspondent said she could hear the sound of bombing from 40km (25 miles) away.
African Union (AU) peacekeepers met the civilians and gave them water but did not intervene in the fighting.
'Tough to enforce'
The UN resolution was sponsored by the US, which says a genocide is being committed against black Africans in Darfur.

The war crimes suspects - Adam Yacub Shant, Gabril Abdul Kareem Badri, Gaffar Mohamed Elhassan and Sheikh Musa Hilal - would be subject to a ban on foreign travel and have any assets held abroad frozen.
The BBC's correspondent at the UN headquarters in New York, Laura Trevelyan, said it had taken weeks to get to this point and the sanctions could be difficult to enforce.
Russia and China, both permanent members of the Security Council with the power to veto the resolution, had initially opposed this move, but chose to abstain because the African nations supported the sanctions.
This is the first time those involved in Darfur's atrocities have been directly targeted.
However the BBC's Jonah Fisher in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, says the effect of the sanctions will be more psychological than physical.
Peace deal?
Sudan's governments has consistently said the scale of the problem in Darfur is being exaggerated for political reasons.
The [AU] proposals are comprehensive and in our opinion they constitute a sound basis for a solution to the crisis
AU mediator Salim Ahmed Salim
It denies backing the Arab Janjaweed militias accused of mass rape, killing and looting.
The UN is also considering taking control of the peace mission from the cash-strapped AU.
Sudan opposes such moves, saying extra funding should instead be given to the 7,000 hard-pressed AU peacekeepers already in Darfur.
The AU is also sponsoring peace talks between the government and rebels and has set a deadline of 30 April for the two sides to reach a deal.
Its chief mediator Salim Ahmed Salim is hopeful that representatives of the government and one of the Darfur rebel groups attending negotiations in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, will agree to the peace plan.
""The proposals are comprehensive and in our opinion they constitute a sound basis for a solution to the crisis,"" he told the BBC's Network Africa programme.
The draft deal addresses the issues of power-sharing, wealth-sharing, security arrangements and the implementation of a comprehensive ceasefire, he said.

Turkish journalist Kadri Gursel released after 11 months in jail,www.dw.com,https://www.dw.com/en/turkish-journalist-kadri-gursel-released-after-11-months-in-jail/a-40681277,06-08-20 0:00,"An Istanbul court ordered the release from detention of Kadri Gursel late on Monday night. He remains one of 17 people on trial charged with links to terror groups through the Cumhuriyet newspaper's coverage of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), the ultra-left Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front (DHKP-C) and the movement of US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen.
About 200 people gathered outside the courthouse on Monday, carrying portraits of the detained journalists and banners with slogans including ""Freedom for journalists"" and ""Independent press cannot be silenced.""

""I ask my release first and then my acquittal because there's no justification left to keep me in prison,"" Gursel, a columnist and editorial director at Cumhuriyet, told the court. Gursel was released from Silivri jail outside Istanbul on Monday night.
Gursel is one of 17 Cumhuriyet staff members who have been charged for critical coverage of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The trial, which began in July, had been adjourned until October 31. If found guilty, some of the accused could face up to 43 years in jail.
Protesters gathered outside the courthouse in support of the jailed journalists
Four journalists, teacher detained
The same court ordered that four other detained suspects must stay in jail: the paper's chairman Akin Atalay, editor-in-chief Murat Sabuncu, investigative reporter Ahmet Sik and accountant Emre Iper.
The court also ordered the continued detention of teacher Ahmet Kemal Aydogdu. He doesn't work for Cumhuriyet but is suspected of maintaining a Twitter account critical of the government. He is accused of being a terror group leader, and although his case is unrelated to the one against Cumhuriyet, it has been merged into the same trial.
There are 171 journalists in Turkish jails, according to the P24 press freedom group. Most of them were arrested under the state of emergency imposed after a failed coup attempt in July last year.

Kraft Heinz's nightmare is far from over,www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/08/investing/kraft-heinz-earnings/index.html,08-08-19 14:01,"New York (CNN Business) Kraft Heinz is a company in crisis. It spent the first half of 2019 embroiled in an accounting scandal. Its CEO resigned. And its sales are in a massive slump as people search for healthier, less-processed foods.
The company finally reported its heavily delayed results for the first half of the year Thursday. The numbers did little to calm investors' nerves.
Kraft Heinz said sales in the first half of 2019 fell nearly 5% from a year ago and profit was down more than half. Although earnings topped forecasts, revenue did not.
And the company disclosed that it was writing down the value of more of its poorly performing brands, including $474 million in charges tied to Velveeta, Maxwell House, Miracle Whip and three other brands. It also took a $744 million charge after lowering sales forecasts for several of its international businesses.
The stock plunged 15% in early trading to a new all-time low and it was the worst performer in the S&P 500. Shares of the company have lost nearly 40% this year.

According to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, “Iran employs a web of front companies to fund terrorist groups across the region, siphoning resources away from the Iranian people and prioritizing terrorist proxies over the basic needs of its people.” OFAC has sanctioned these entities and persons for a multitude of “malign activities”, including: smuggling; money laundering; selling Iranian oil to the Syrian regime; promoting propaganda efforts in Iraq on behalf of the IRGC-QF; intimidating Iraqi politicians; and illicit use of funds and public donations.
Accordingly, 15 individuals and 5 companies have been placed on OFAC’s Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) List. The five companies are:
Reconstruction Organization of the Holy Shrines in Iraq (ROHSI) – an IRGC-QF-controlled organization based in Iran and Iraq.

OFAC states that the Kosar Company has served as a base for Iranian intelligence activities in Iraq, including the shipment of weapons and ammunition to Iranian-backed terrorist militia groups. Additionally, Kosar Company has received millions of dollars in transfers from the Central Bank of Iran.

Additionally, Kosar Company has received millions of dollars in transfers from the Central Bank of Iran. Al Khamael Maritime Services (AKMS) – an Iraq-based company operating out of Umm Qasr port in which the IRGC-QF has a financial interest.

As a result of this action, all property and interests in property of these persons that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons must be blocked and reported to OFAC. Because U.S. persons are generally prohibited from dealing with entities on the SDN List, persons who engage in certain transactions with these designated persons may themselves be exposed to designation.

Rookie ministers a source of concern for Abe at special Diet session,www.japantimes.co.jp,https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/09/23/national/politics-diplomacy/rookie-ministers-source-concern-abe-special-diet-session/,23-09-19 22:17,"Some of the 13 rookie ministers in Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s new Cabinet are a source of concern for the administration at the upcoming extraordinary Diet session, according to political pundits.
The 13 people landed their first ministerial posts in the Cabinet reshuffle carried out by the prime minister on Sept. 11. Some may be considered easy targets for opposition parties during Diet debates when the special session kicks off Oct. 4, given questionable or inadequate remarks they have made in the past.
The ruling coalition, led by Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party, therefore plans to limit the number of government-sponsored bills to be submitted to the Diet session to about 15, and that number could be shaved further, sources said.
The lowest number of bills presented to a major extraordinary legislative session since Abe launched his current administration in late 2012 was 13, at last year’s extra session, which ran for 48 days from late October to early December.
This will be the first session since the Cabinet shake-up and the first for full-fledged debate between the ruling and opposition camps since the Upper House election July 21. It is expected to run until early December.
Of the government bills expected to be submitted, the outlook is murky for an amendment to the national strategic special zone law for creating “super cities,” in which artificial intelligence and other state-of-the-art technologies would be utilized.
The government submitted a similar bill during this year’s regular Diet session that ended in June. It was scrapped due to insufficient coordination within the ruling bloc of the LDP and Komeito.
A government official expressed concern that regional revitalization minister Seigo Kitamura, one of the 13 rookie ministers and the person in charge of the legislation, “may be unable to sufficiently respond” to questions from the opposition camp.
Kitamura failed to properly answer questions from reporters about regional revitalization policies at his inaugural news conference Sept. 11.
The opposition may grill new education minister Koichi Hagiuda, one of the closest aides to Abe, over a favoritism scandal related to school operator Kake Educational Institution, which is headed by a friend of the prime minister. Hagiuda is responsible for a planned government bill to revise the special law on teachers’ salaries.
Other government bills will include one seeking ratification of a proposed trade pact between Japan and the United States, which is expected to be signed by Abe and U.S. President Donald Trump at their meeting in New York on Wednesday.
Apart from government-sponsored legislation, ruling and opposition lawmakers are expected to submit a joint bill to amend the law on damages payments to former leprosy patients subjected to the government’s quarantine policy, so that their relatives can receive compensation as well.
Potentially contentious issues will include social security reform.
The Diet schedule is bound to be tight partly because of Abe’s planned overseas trips.
He is scheduled to travel to Thailand in late October for a series of meetings related to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and to Chile in mid-November to take part in a summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.

The plan includes cutting down import dependence, especially from China, by focussing aggressively on substitution while improving safety compliance and quality goods to gain global market share. The commerce and industry ministry is mulling setting up groups to draw up strategies for sectors where China has vacated space and countries are looking to diversify suppliers.As per an analysis done by the commerce department, medical textiles, electronics, plastics and toys are some sectors whose exports can be promoted in the next three months or phase one while phase two exports include gems and jewellery, pharmaceuticals and steel, in the next six months.Commerce and industry ministry Piyush Goyal is likely to discuss these plans with the external affairs minister and Indian missions abroad on Thursday.“There are geographical issues of some countries because they don’t want to put all their eggs in one basket, which is China. We are looking at sectors where we can improve capacity and reduce costs especially where dumping is happening,” said one official.As part of the strategy, India will look at areas where it has capability but continues to import and focus on the areas of core competence. Piyush Goyal on Wednesday told exporters that with shortage of food items in several countries due to supply chain disruptions, it is a good opportunity for export of agricultural and processed food items. He told exporters that incentives can be given, but they have to be “justified, reasonable, and WTO compliant”.“Covid-19 will emerge as a non-tariff barrier as countries would insist on various certifications.

He is the chairman of the Communist Party of Social Justice and a prominent Freemason, serving as Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Russia since 2007.[1][2] As a candidate for the 2008 presidential election, he received 968,344 votes or 1.30% of the Russian electorate.[3]
Political career [ edit ]
Bogdanov began his political career in 1990, when he joined the Democratic Party of Russia. He ascended to the leadership of the party in 2005, after he was elected at the 19th party congress.[4]
Russian president Vladimir Putin described Bogdanov as ""an ambitious young man with progressive views"".[5]
2008 presidential campaign [ edit ]
Bogdanov was a presidential candidate in Russia's 2008 election.
During his campaign he showed support for Russian integration with Europe and for less state involvement in the economy.[6]
The British newspaper Times Online articulated suspicions that Bogdanov could be a puppet candidate used by the government in an attempt to make the elections appear legitimate.[7] Bogdanov dismissed these claims as ""fantasies"".[3] Nonetheless, many serious political commentators have described Bogdanov as a decoy carefully positioned by Putin to split and distract political opposition, whilst a 2012 article published by the Institute of Modern Russia (IMR) described Bogdanov as a ""well-known Kremlin shill"", or confidence trickster's decoy.[8] The IMR associates Bogdanov with more than thirty new political parties, stating ""According to Kremlin operatives, the creation of dozens of new parties will confuse voters, split the opposition vote, and hand the ruling party a victory even with significantly reduced support."" Other external commentators have accused Bogdanov, and his political parties, of being controlled by the Kremlin, so as to give an appearance of democracy.[9]:78
After 2008 election [ edit ]
In November 2008, the Democratic Party of Russia was disbanded and its followers joined the ranks of the new party Right Cause, which united supporters of right-wing West-oriented Russian liberalism. At the same time Bogdanov founded the Andrei Bogdanov Centre, an independent non-profit organization for the development of social technologies, which in many respects became a successor to the Democratic Party.[10]
Bogdanov entered the race for the mayorship of Sochi on 25 March 2009.[11] However, he withdrew from the election on 13 April 2009, urging his supporters to vote instead for acting mayor Anatoly Pakhomov, the government-backed pro-Putin[12] candidate.[13]
In 2014 Bogdanov became the leader of the Communist Party of Social Justice. He had previously been the leader of the Democratic party, whose current leadership team also includes Bogdanov's son, Timur Bogdanov, according to the party's website.[14]
2018 presidential campaign [ edit ]
In September 2017, Bogdanov declared his intention to participate in the 2018 Presidential Election,[15] but his candidature was cancelled after he failed to submit the necessary registration papers to the Central Election Commission of the Russian Federation.[16]
Freemasonry [ edit ]
On 30 June 2007 Andrei Bogdanov was elected and took office as the Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Russia.[17] During the election and inauguration, representatives of the United Grand Lodge of England (the world's oldest Grand Lodge) and several American Grand Lodges were present. The Grand Lodge of Russia, headed by Andrei Bogdanov, is recognized by the ""Commission for the Recognition of the Conference of Grand Lodges (Grand Masters) of North America"" as corresponding to ""standards of recognition"".[2][18] Andrei Bogdanov is publicly open about his practice of Freemasonry and has given interviews in the media as the Grand Master of the GLoR.
In July 2010, Andrei Bogdanov was re-elected to the post of Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Russia until 2015.[1] He is a member of the 33° Scottish Rite.
In September 2010 Bogdanov was admitted to the Holy Royal Arch in the Royal Somerset House & Inverness Chapter (London) in the United Kingdom. He subsequently began establishing Royal Arch Freemasonry in Russia.[19]
On 28 March 2015, at the GLoR annual assembly, Andrei Bogdanov was again re-elected as the Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Russia. According to the General Regulations of the GLoR, Andrei Bogdanov will hold the post of Grand Master for a further 5 years, until 2020.[1] At that point he will have held the office continuously for 13 years.
Personal life [ edit ]
Bogdanov is married to Irina Bogdanova. Their son Timur Bogdanov works with his father on several political projects. Bogdanov is a member of the Russian Orthodox Church.",Andrey Vladimirovich TSCHERESOW,20-01-08 0:00,d42733ce8a5c706cbc52e8bbfb4d0994e56870f91e2c34aa0148c61fe967b373,0.705932885,"[{'score': 0.4396815598011017, 'topic': 'misconduct'}]","[{'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.3905680775642395, 'name': 'Andrey Vladimirovich Bogdanov', 'topic': 'corruption'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.42634764313697815, 'name': 'Andrey Vladimirovich Bogdanov', 'topic': 'bribery'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.46716979146003723, 'name': '30 June 2007 Andrei Bogdanov', 'topic': 'corruption'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.43931934237480164, 'name': '30 June 2007 Andrei Bogdanov', 'topic': 'bribery'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.4878356456756592, 'name': 'Timur Bogdanov', 'topic': 'corruption'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.42039814591407776, 'name': 'Timur Bogdanov', 'topic': 'bribery'}, {'sentiment': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.3926151990890503, 'name': '2014 Bogdanov', 'topic': 'corruption'}, {'sentiment': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.404075026512146, 'name': '2014 Bogdanov', 'topic': 'bribery'}, {'sentiment': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.346344918012619, 'name': 'September 2010 Bogdanov', 'topic': 'corruption'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.4764147400856018, 'name': 'September 2010 Bogdanov', 'topic': 'bribery'}]","Russian politician

US slaps sanctions on 3 Iran-linked Iraqi militia heads over protest abuses,www.timesofisrael.com,https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-slaps-sanctions-on-iran-linked-iraqis-over-protest-abuses/,06-12-19 21:22,"WASHINGTON — The United States on Friday announced sanctions on three Iranian-linked Iraqi militia leaders for allegedly assisting the crackdown on demonstrations that have swept the country.
“The Iraqi people want their country back. They are calling for genuine reform and accountability and for trustworthy leaders who will put Iraq’s national interests first,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement.
The United States imposed sanctions on three Iraqis — Qais al-Khazali, Laith al-Khazali, and Hussein Falil Aziz al-Lami — who are part of the Popular Mobilization Forces, or Hashed al-Shaabi, a Shiite militia movement close to Iran.

The three militia leaders were designated under a US law that will ban them from travel to the United States and seize any assets they have in the country.
The United States also placed sanctions on an Iraqi politician, Khamis Farhan al-Khanjar al-Issawi, on bribery charges.

Iran Fails to Silence Critics by Changing Woman's Death Sentence From Stoning to Hanging,www.foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/world/iran-fails-to-silence-critics-by-changing-womans-death-sentence-from-stoning-to-hanging,26-03-15 20:36,"Iranian officials, already under fire for sentencing a woman to death by stoning, has done little to diminish international outcry by instead pursuing an execution by hanging.
Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, 44, was convicted back in 2006 for an “illicit relationship outside of marriage” and sentenced to death by stoning. The execution was delayed after protests across the globe, and Ashtiani has been detained in prison ever since.
On Sunday, the head judiciary, Malek Ajdar Sharifi said the prison does not have the “necessary facilities” to carry forth with the stoning and that they are considering hanging as an alternative.
Sharifi told the Isna News Agency that an investigation is being conducted to see if it is legally and religiously possible to execute Ashtiani by hanging and that once a determination is made, the sentence will be carried out.
The comments have reignited efforts to get Ashtiani freed.
“Iran’s most recent attempt to escape another international embarrassment by converting the sentence to death by hanging still results in Iran violating its obligations under international law,” said Tiffany Barrans of The American Center for Law and Justice, a Washington-based civil rights watchdog group that is calling for the unconditional release of Ashtiani.
“The regime’s post hoc attempts to justify Ashtiani’s death sentence by digging up old criminal charges should be seen as nothing less than an attempt to hide its flagrant disregard for human rights,"" Barrans said. ""Ashtiani’s previous charge and sentence for her alleged involvement with her husband’s murder, a sentence which did not involve death, is suspect at best.""
The U.S. State Department has also showed concern over the ruling calling for Iran to “live up to its international commitments to prevent cruel and inhuman treatment.”
“We remain deeply troubled by this case. The Iranian government has previously stated that Ms. Ashtiani would not face execution by stoning, but her fate remains unclear,” a State Department spokeperson told FoxNews.com. ""We continue to have serious concerns regarding the judicial proceedings that led to her conviction. We once again call on the Iranian government to conduct her case with the transparency and due process written in Iran’s own constitution as well as in the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, to which Iran is a signatory.”
According to Article 7 of the ICCPR convention, “no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.” Article 6ix states that a death sentence should only be imposed for the most serious of crimes.
“Adultery, by all international standards, does not qualify as one of the ‘most serious crimes,’” Barrans said.",Malek Ajdar SHARIFI,26-03-15 20:36,af0508d426208259f36d77d87afc714cbaac8491743263e8f43e9697635efbab,0.687113434,"[{'score': 0.6999085545539856, 'topic': 'crime'}, {'score': 0.4286753535270691, 'topic': 'tax_evasion'}, {'score': 0.40405604243278503, 'topic': 'identity_theft'}, {'score': 0.47349581122398376, 'topic': 'sanctions'}, {'score': 0.4355410635471344, 'topic': 'terrorism'}]","[{'sentiment': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.563970148563385, 'name': 'Tiffany Barrans', 'topic': 'sanctions'}, {'sentiment': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.4035337269306183, 'name': 'Tiffany Barrans', 'topic': 'terrorism'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.5670556426048279, 'name': 'Tiffany Barrans', 'topic': 'assets'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.5290005207061768, 'name': 'Tiffany Barrans', 'topic': 'misconduct'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.40669554471969604, 'name': 'Tiffany Barrans', 'topic': 'bribery'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.41570115089416504, 'name': 'Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani', 'topic': 'embezzlement'}, {'sentiment': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.4347122311592102, 'name': 'Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani', 'topic': 'sanctions'}, {'sentiment': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.39015963673591614, 'name': 'Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani', 'topic': 'terrorism'}, {'sentiment': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.4289596676826477, 'name': 'Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani', 'topic': 'crime'}, {'sentiment': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.39950016140937805, 'name': 'Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani', 'topic': 'misconduct'}, {'sentiment': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.38405853509902954, 'name': 'Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani', 'topic': 'tax_evasion'}, {'sentiment': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.5050550103187561, 'name': 'Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani', 'topic': 'money_laundering'}, {'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.42845988273620605, 'name': 'Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani', 'topic': 'bribery'}]","Iranian officials, already under fire for sentencing a woman to death by stoning, has done little to diminish international outcry by instead pursuing an execution by hanging.

The Trump administration stressed their links to Pakistan, The Associated Press reported.
According to the report, among them are senior members of Taliban regime in Afghanistan – 1996 to 2001, including former central bank governor Abdul Samad Sani.
The six individuals, said to have been part of Taliban leadership bodies in Pakistan, are alleged to have provided financing and weapons for militants involved in attacks on US-led coalition forces.
“The Pakistan government must work with us to deny the Taliban and the Haqqani network sanctuary and to aggressively target terrorist fundraising,” Mandelker, the undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in a statement, as quoted by AP.
The blacklisted individuals include: Abdul Qadeer Basir Abdul Baseer, said to have led the finance commission of the Taliban leadership Shura in Peshawar.
He is alleged to have provided tens of thousands of dollars for Taliban attacks in Kunar province of Afghanistan last fall.
